<b><i>CreditCardCreditAdd</i></b><br />
If a QuickBooks user returns merchandise and receives credit, the credit is entered 
in Quickbooks and assigned to the appropriate expense account. Typically, the 
assigned expense account reflects the same account, customer, and class that were 
assigned when the merchandise was first purchased. (The original purchase would 
be described by a CreditCardCharge message.)
