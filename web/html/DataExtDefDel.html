<b><i>DataExtDefDel</i></b><br />
Deletes the private data extension definition specified by OwnerID and DataExtName. 
This delete will be successful only for private data extensions. <br />

You cannot use this to delete any custom field definition, whether the custom field was created by
the user via the QB UI or via the SDK DataExtDefAdd request.<br />
<br />
This request should be exercised with caution. Once you invoke this on your private extension,
you will not be able to re-add a private extension with that same name and OwnerID. (If you want
to re-use the name from a deleted definition, you'll have to supply a different OwnerID.)
