<b><i>metaData</i></b><br /><br />
This is used in a query to cause a count of query objects to be returned.  You can specify that the count of query objects is to be returned with the returned objects, or you can specify that only a count and no data is returned. (The default is that no count is returned.) A common use of this feature is to specify a count with no data in order to determine how many objects to expect from the actual query.<br />
<br />
If you don't want a query to return a count, either don't use this feature, or specify the value NoMetaData. If you want only a count, specify the value MetaDataOnly. If you want data and a count, specify MetaDataAndResponseData.<br />
<br />
You should be aware that the count returned via this setting is not guaranteed to be exact: it could be off slightly due to new object creation or deletions.
