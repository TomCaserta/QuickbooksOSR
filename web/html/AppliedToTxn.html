<p><b><i>AppliedToTxn</i></b><br />
  In a <em>ReceivePayment</em> message, each AppliedToTxn aggregate represents
  the transaction to which this part of the payment is being applied.
  Four types of transactions can
    receive
    payments in QuickBooks: invoices, statement charges (though not through the
    SDK), general journal debits, and checks.
  (For 
  example, a customer job might receive a payment reimbursing a check that was
   written for an expense for that customer job.)<br />
   <br />
   In a <em>BillPayment</em> message, each AppliedToTxn aggregate represents
   the bill transaction to which this part of the  payment is being applied. <br />
   <br />
  If you
    include AppliedToTxnAdd aggregates with duplicate
  TxnIDs in the same Add request, 
you will receive an error. </p>
