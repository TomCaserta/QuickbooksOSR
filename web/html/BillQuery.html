<b><i>BillQuery</i></b><br /><br />
Provides functionality found in the Find/Advanced Find window to find bills that are to be paid by
check. The Find/Advanced Find windows can be reached by clicking the Find
button on the main QuickBooks menubar, by selecting Edit->Find, or simply by using the shortcut
CTRL-F. Notice that you can use the metaData attribute inside the query tag if you want only a
count of the bills that will be returned from the query.<br />
<br />
If you know the bill's transaction ID or reference number, you could use these, or search by transaction date,
or search by the date where the bill was last modified. You can search for paid/unpaid bills by using
the PaidStatus flag.<br />
<br />
If you need additional filters, you can use the entity filter to search for bills from a specific vendor
or vendor sub (using the ListIDWithChildren or FullNameWithChildren tags). You can also 
search for bills entered against a particular account (the APAccountRef specified in the originating
BillAdd request). You can specify all subaccounts by using the various *WithChildren tags. For example,
to find all bills entered against Checking where you have multiple checking accounts, you would use
the ListIDWithChildren or FullNameWithChildren tags inside your AccountFilter tags. You can
filter on the RefNumber or RefNumber range. Notice that all of these 
filters can be used together (ANDed) if desired.<br />
<br />
If you want bill line items returned from the query, you must use the IncludeLineItems tag. Notice that
you don't specify line item groups. If line item groups were set up for the line items, the returned line
items are automatically segregated by group.<br />
<br />
You can get all of the linked transactions such as PurchaseOrders and Credits by using the IncludeLinkedTxns tag.
You can get public data extensions (these are custom data whose fields can be displayed in QuickBooks) by
supplying the OwnerID tag set to 0. To get private data extensions (custom data not displayable in 
QuickBooks) you must use the OwnerID tag set to the known GUID value. You must know the GUID value in order
to access private data extensions.<br />
<br />
To prevent the return of too much data, you can use MaxReturned to limit the total number of bills returned
from the query. In addition, you can limit the type of data that is returned for each bill, using
IncludeRetElement. Finally, you can specify whether each bill contains line items using the IncludeLineItems,
which by default is False (no line item data).
