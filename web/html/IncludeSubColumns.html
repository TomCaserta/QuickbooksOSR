<b><i>IncludeSubcolumns</i></b><br />
The default value is false, which means that the report will not include any subcolumn 
information. To include all available types of subcolumns for this report, set 
IncludeSubcolumns to true. The SDK will not return subcolumn information for 
data that can be easily computed. (For example, the SDK does not return the &quot;percent 
of row&quot; column.)
