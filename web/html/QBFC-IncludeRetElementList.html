<b><i>IncludeRetElementList</i></b><br /><br />
You use this if you want to limit the data that will be returned in the response. 
In this list, you specify the name of each top-level element or aggregate that 
you want to be returned in the 
response to the request. You cannot specify fields within an aggregate, 
for example, you cannot
specify a City within an Address: you must specify Address and will get 
the entire address.<br />
<br />

The names specified in the list are not parsed, so you must be especially careful 
to supply valid names, properly cased. No error is returned in the status code if 
you specify an invalid name.<br />

<br />
Notice that if you want to return custom data or private data extensions,
you must specify the DataExtRet element 
and you must supply the OwnerID set to either a value of 0 (custom data) 
or the GUID for the private data.
