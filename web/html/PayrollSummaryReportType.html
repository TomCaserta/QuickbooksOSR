<p>The type of payroll report:</p>
<ul>
  <li>EmployeeEarningsSummary<br />
    This report shows information similar to the payroll summary report, but in 
    a different layout. The report has a row for each employee and a column for 
    each payroll item. <br />
  </li>
  <li>PayrollLiabilityBalances<br />
    This report lists the payroll liabilities the QuickBooks company owes to various 
    agencies, such as the federal government, your state government, insurance 
    plan administrators, labor unions, etc. The report covers unpaid liabilities 
    incurred during the period of time shown in the From and To fields. If the 
    company paid a liability incurred within the date range of the report, the 
    report omits that liability, even if the payment occurred after the ending 
    date of the report. <br />
  </li>
  <li>PayrollSummary<br />
    This report shows the total wages, taxes withheld, deductions from net pay, 
    additions to net pay, and employer-paid taxes and contributions for each employee 
    on the payroll. <br />
	  </li>
</ul>
