<b><i>TransactionQuery</i></b><br /><br />
TransactionQuery is a generic transaction query that provides functionality (e.g. filters) 
similar to the Advanced Find window in the QuickBooks UI. It allows you to search for 
transactions across different transaction types. In contrast to the other transaction-specific 
queries, the TransactionQuery only returns data common to all transactions, such as TxnID, 
type, dates, accountRef, and so on. This query does return condensed transactions.<br />
<br />
Accordingly, if additional and more transaction-specific data is required, a subsequent 
call to the desired query can be used to get that transaction-specific data. For example, 
the TransactionQuery can be used to present all transactions in a certain date range, then 
the user can select a particular transaction, say an invoice transaction. In response to this 
choice, you could do an InvoiceQuery to pull up all of the invoice data, similar to QuickZoom 
in the QuickBooks UI.<br />
<br />
<b>Important</b><br /><br />
You should be aware that permissions are obeyed in this query. So, if you set the transaction
 type filter to "All" (or if you don't set it at all), the query will be searching only those 
transaction types that are permissible types for the user currently logged in. Accordingly, if 
instead of "all," you specify a transaction type that the currently logged in user is not permitted
to access, you will get a runtime error, even if other permissible transaction types were specified 
as well.<br />
<br />

Finally, the transaction query is subject to sensitive data access level restrictions
and payroll subscription status.
