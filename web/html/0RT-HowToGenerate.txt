CREATING THE ONLINE REFERENCE MANUAL FOR QBXML:

The tool used to create the QBXML Online Reference Manual is 
docgen, which can be found in CVS under 
platform/java/com/intuit/util/docgen.  This can create
either the QBD or QBO version of the tool.  Its usage is

java com/intuit/util/docgen/docgen -docs <output_directory> 
-ex <exceptions_file> <product_flag> <input_xml_files>

For example, I run it as

java -DSBNHome=/v/inclink.com/jwortman/ com/intuit/util/docgen/docgen 
-docs /v/inclink.com/jwortman/www/output/doc -ex ./ORTexceptions.xml 
-qbd /u/jwortman/qbn/platform/xml/source/qbxml20.xml+/u/jwortman/qbn/platform/xml/source/qbxmlext20.xml

to create QBD documentation, and

java -DSBNHome=/v/inclink.com/jwortman/ com/intuit/util/docgen/docgen 
-docs /v/inclink.com/jwortman/www/output/doc -ex ./ORTexceptions.xml 
-qbo /u/jwortman/qbn/platform/xml/source/qbxml20.xml+/u/jwortman/qbn/platform/xml/source/qbxmlext20.xml 

to create QBO documentation.

The exceptions file is optional, but in all practical cases 
ORTexceptions.xml should be used.  This file is checked into CVS 
in the same directory.

It is important that a few files are in the output directory when
docgen is run.  These are requests-QBD.html.xp and requests-QBO.html.xp.

In addition, the files index.html, index-QBD.html, index-QBO.html, and
styleguide.css must be present in the output directory to view the
manual.  These files and the xp files are stored in Perforce under the
same directory as the rest of the tool.

==================================================================

CREATING THE OBJECT REFERENCE MANUAL FOR QBFC:

The tool used to create the QBFC Version of the Object Reference 
Manual is codegen, which can be found in CVS under
platform/java/com/intuit/util/codegen.  It is important to note 
that codegen has other uses besides creating the QBFC Object Help, 
and needs to be run as described below in order to create the doc.  
It is also important that dtdgen (qbn/platform/java/com/intuit/util/dtdgen)
is run before codegen as it generates some files which are needed 
for codegen to function properly.

The usage of this tool for the purpose of creating doc is

java com/intuit/util/codegen/codegen -o <output_directory> -ex <exceptions_file> 
-ort <input_file_from_dtdgen>

For example, I run it as

java -DSBNHome=/v/inclink.com/jwortman/ com/intuit/util/codegen/codegen 
-o /v/inclink.com/jwortman/www/output/doc -ex ../docgen/ORTexceptions.xml 
-ort /v/inclink.com/jwortman/www/output/java/qbXMLCOM-j.xml

Again, the exceptions file is optional but really should always be used.

Before this tool is run, the file requests-QBFC-QBD.html.xp must be
present in the output directory.

In order to view the manual, index.html, index-QBFC-QBD.html, and
styleguide.css must be in the output directory.  These files are
all stored in Perforce.

===================================================================

RESULTS:

The latest versions of the generated tools can be found in Perforce 
under //IDN/QBSDK/Gecko/ORT.  All versions of the tool are stored 
in this directory as they share many files.

It is best to make sure that all of the latest files from Perforce
are in your outout directory BEFORE running docgen or codegen to
update the tool.  Having the latest version of the Online Reference
Manual in the output directory will prevent hand-written 
description files from being replaced by stub files.

===================================================================

RELEASING THE MANUAL:

When the Online Reference Manual is being released for a new version
of the SDK, the latest versions of all files should be copied from
//IDN/QBSDK/Gecko/ORT.  However, the following files in this 
directory should be excluded from the release:
requests-QBD.html.xp
requests-QBO.html.xp
requests-QBFC-QBD.html.xp
0RT-HowToGenerate.txt
0RT-ReadMe.doc
ORTexceptions.xml
