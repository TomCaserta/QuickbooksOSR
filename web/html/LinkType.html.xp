<p><i><b>LinkType<br />
  </b></i>Indicates the nature of the link between the transactions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>AMTTYPE means the two transactions are linked based on an amount value (for 
    example an invoice linked to a payment).</li>
  <li>QUANTYPE means the two transactions are linked based on a quantity. This 
    affects transactions that are linked to sales orders, estimates and purchase 
    orders. For example, an invoice might be created from a sales order, based 
    on the quantity of items received. </li>
