<p>Subscribes an application to receive the specified data events. Subsequent to this subscription, your application will receive
the subscribed-to events, which are returned to your callback in a QBXMLEvents message. Make sure you record the
SubscriberID because you'll need it to remove the subscription later, using the SubscriptionDel message. For details about the event-notification
feature, see the chapter called &quot;Event Notification&quot; in the <i>QB SDK Programmer's Guide</i>.</p>

<p>Be aware that the qbXML version used to subscribe to an event must be used in subsequent subscription queries. That is, if you
construct a subscription query sing qbXML 4.0, and then do a subscription query using qbXML 5.0, your 4.0 subscription will
not be returned in the query.</p>

<p>This request must be invoked using the request processor method ProcessSubscription(), if you use qbXML.

If you use QBFC, this request must be appended to an ISubscriptionMsgSetRequest object instantiated by the
QBSessionManager method CreateSubscriptionMsgSetRequest() and invoked by the method DoSubscriptionRequests().</p>
