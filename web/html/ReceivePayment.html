<b><i>ReceivePayment</i></b><br />
A receive payment transaction is used for one or more of these purposes: 
<ol>
  <li>To record a customer&#146;s payment against an invoice for one or more jobs,</li>
  <li>To set a discount (for early payment, for example), </li>
  <li>To set a credit (from previously returned merchandise, for example).</li>
</ol>
If full payment is received at the time of sale, it is recorded using a sales 
receipt transaction, not a receive payments transaction.<br />
<br />
<b><i>IMPORTANT</i></b><br />
In a SalesReceiptAdd or ReceivePaymentAdd request that contains credit card transaction data supplied from QBMS transaction responses, you must specify the payment method (using the PaymentMethodRef aggregate).
