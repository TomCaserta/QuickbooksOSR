<b><i>VendorCreditMod</i></b><br />
Modifies a vendor credit.  Be careful! If you modify ANY line item, you must fully re-construct the line item table as you want it
because if you edit even a single line item, any line item that is NOT in the vendor credit mod will be omitted. For full details,
see the QB SDK Programmer's Guide chapter on modifying and deleting transactions and list objects.<br />
<br />
A vendor credit is also known as a "bill credit". That is, it is a credit that
<i>a vendor owes you</i> because you overpaid your bill, returned merchandise, or for some other reason.
The VendorCredit is referenced in a BilPayment transaction,  inside the SetCredit aggregate. <br />
<br />
A VendorCredit should not be confused with a Credit Memo, which is something <i>you owe your customer</i> and which
is referenced in a ReceivePayment request.
