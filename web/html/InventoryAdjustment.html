<b><i>InventoryAdjustment</i></b><br />
  If the following conditions aren't met, you will receive an error if you try 
  to add an inventory adjustment through the SDK:<br />

  <ul> 

    <li>The QuickBooks company file must be open in single-user mode. (This is 
      also true in the user interface: you cannot adjust the inventory while the 
      company file is open in multi-user mode.) </li>

    <li>The inventory adjustment form must be closed in the QuickBooks user interface.</li>
  </ul>
</body>
