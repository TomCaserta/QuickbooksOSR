If the following conditions aren't met, you will receive an error if you try 
  to add an inventory adjustment through the SDK:<br />

  <ul> 

    <li>The QuickBooks company file must be open in single-user mode, unless you are using QuickBooks Enterprise edition, which allows multi-user mode for this request. (This is 
      also true in the user interface: you cannot adjust the inventory while the 
      company file is open in multi-user mode, again except for Enterprise.) </li>

    <li>The inventory adjustment form must be closed in the QuickBooks user interface.</li>
  </ul>
</body>
