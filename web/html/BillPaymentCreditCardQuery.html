<b><i>BillPaymentCreditCardQuery</i></b><br /><br />
Provides functionality found in the Find/Advanced Find window to find bill payments that were paid by
credit card. The Find/Advanced Find windows can be reached by clicking the Find
button on the main QuickBooks menubar, by selecting Edit->Find, or simply by using the shortcut
CTRL-F. Notice that you can use the metaData attribute inside the query tag if you want only a
count of the bill payments that will be returned from the query.<br />
<br />
If you know the bill's transaction ID or reference number, you could use these, or search by transaction date,
or search by the date where the bill was last modified.<br />
<br />
<b>Important:</b><br />
If you made a bill payment by credit card, and ONLY applied a credit using SetCredit (no funds
were applied other than the credit), then that payment will not be returned in this query because it is
not considered a separate transaction and has no TxnID. To get that kind of payment, you must do a
BillQuery on the original bill and specify IncludeLinkedTxns. Any applied credit will be linked directly
to the bill.<br />
<br />
If you need additional filters, you can use the entity filter to search for bills from a specific vendor
or vendor sub (using the ListIDWithChildren or FullNameWithChildren tags). You can also 
search for bills entered against a particular account (the APAccountRef specified in the originating
BillAdd request). You can specify all subaccounts by using the various *WithChildren tags. For example,
to find all bills entered against Checking where you have multiple checking accounts, you would use
the ListIDWithChildren or FullNameWithChildren tags inside your AccountFilter tags. Finally, you can
filter on the RefNumber or RefNumber range. Notice that all of these 
filters can be used together (ANDed) if desired.<br />
<br />
To prevent the return of too much data, you can use MaxReturned to limit the total number of bills returned
from the query. In addition, you can limit the type of data that is returned for each bill, using
IncludeRetElement. Finally, you can specify whether each bill contains line items using the IncludeLineItems,
which by default is False (no line item data).
