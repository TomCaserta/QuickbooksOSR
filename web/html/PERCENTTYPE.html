<p><b><i>PERCENTTYPE</i></b><br />
  Percentages are specified out of 100 percent, but they can be greater than 100
  and can be negative. The percent symbol (%) is not allowed. For QB 2009 and newer, and
  qbXML 8.0 and greater, the maximum allowed
  length of a PERCENTTYPE value is 15 digits (in 10.5 format). For older QB and
  qbXML spec, the maximum allowed length is 12 digits (in 7.5 format).</p>
  <p>When the SDK returns
  a PERCENTTYPE value, it will pad the number to two decimal places if necessary.
  For example, 1 would be returned as 1.00. </p>
<p><b>About Decimal Values</b><br />
  Decimal values include amounts, quantities, and percents. They can be positive
  or negative. They can include only numeric characters, the + symbol, the - symbol,
  and a decimal point. The + symbol is optional for positive numbers. For decimal
  values, 0 is not the same as a blank because a blank means no value has been
  established. </p>
