<b><i>OwnerIDList</i></b><br />
Zero or more OwnerID values. OwnerID refers to the owner of a data extension:<br />

  <ul> 
   
    <li>If OwnerID is 0, this is a public data extension, also known as a custom 
      field. Custom fields appear in the QuickBooks UI.</li>

    <li>If OwnerID is a GUID, for example {6B063959-81B0-4622-85D6-F548C8CCB517}, 
      this field is a private data extension defined by an integrated application. 
      Private data extensions do not appear in the QuickBooks UI.</li>
  </ul>

Note that OwnerID values are not case-sensitive, meaning that if you enter an 
OwnerID value with lower-case letters, the value will be saved and returned with 
upper-case letters. <br />
<br />
When you share a private data extension with another application, the other application 
must know both the OwnerID and the DataExtName, as these together form a data 
extension's unique name.
