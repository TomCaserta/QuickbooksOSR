<b><i>PaymentTxnID</i></b><br />
For the PaymentTxnID, use either of these two values:<br />

  <ul> 

    <li>A TxnID value exactly as it is returned by the ReceivePaymentToDepositQuery 
      request, or </li>

    <li>A TxnID value exactly as it is returned in a ReceivePaymentAdd response. 
    </li>
  </ul>

If you do not include a PaymentTxnLineID and include a PaymentTxnID for a transaction 
  that includes payment lines, only the first payment line from that transaction 
  will be deposited.
