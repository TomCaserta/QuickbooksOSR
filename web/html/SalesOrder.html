<p><b><i>SalesOrder</i></b><br />
  A sales order tracks inventory that is on back order for a customer. In QuickBooks, 
  sales orders and invoices use similar fields, and a sales order can be converted 
  into an invoice once the inventory is in stock. <br />
<br />
 You can create Sales Orders only with QuickBooks Premier and above.  However, if you are accessing a company file created in Premier and above from a lesser edition of QuickBooks (such as Pro), you should be able to do queries against SalesOrders and also Mods. <br />
<br />
Since a sales order is a non-posting transaction, QuickBooks business logic doesn’t require the sales tax information at the point where the SalesOrder is added. (In the OSR this is an optional field.) However, the sales tax item IS required for the invoice. So if the SalesOrder doesn’t have a sales tax item set for it, you need to modify it so that it does have one before you create an invoice using that sales order. </p>
