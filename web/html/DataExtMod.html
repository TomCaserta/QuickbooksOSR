<b><i>DataExtMod</i></b><br />
This request can only be invoked if a data extension definition has already been added 
to the target object (for example, the customer John Henry) by a DataExtDefAdd or by 
the user specifying a custom field value for that object via the QuickBooks UI.<br />
<br />

If you want to clear the data extension value (to make the custom field or private extension
blank), you must use DataExtDel. The DataExtMod request cannot be used to clear the field.<br />
<br />
Both DataExtAdd and DataExtMod cause a Modify event to be generated for the parent object.
For example invoking one of these on a Customer causes a Customer Modify event. The Time Modified
value for that parent object is also updated.<br />
<br />
Notice that the Mod operation does not support macros like DataExtAdd does.
