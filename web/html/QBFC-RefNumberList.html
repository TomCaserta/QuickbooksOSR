<b><i>RefNumberList</i></b><br />
A list of one or more RefNumber values. A RefNumber is a string of characters 
that refers to a transaction and that can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks 
user. <strong><br />
<br />
Note (especially relevant to CheckAdd requests): </strong>When RefNumber is left 
blank in an SDK transaction add request, the RefNumber will be left blank in QuickBooks. 
This behavior is new as of QBFC3. It used to select the next sequential reference 
number since the last one used by QuickBooks, as though no RefNumber had been 
provided. This is especially relevant to CheckAdd requests because with the current 
behavior, you will not know the number until the check is printed.
