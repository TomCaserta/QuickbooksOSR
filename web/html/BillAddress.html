<b><i>BillAddress</i></b><br />
Whatever address you specify in this aggregate must not result in an address greater
than 5 lines, otherwise you'll get a runtime error, because QuickBooks doesn't support addresses more
than 5 lines.
<br />
<br />
There are two ways to specify an address within this aggregate:
<ol>
<li>Using Addr1 through Addr3 along with the other possible aggregate elements, such as City, State, Postalcode.</li>
<li>Using Addr1, Addr2, Addr3, Addr4, and Addr5 to fully specify the address. If you use this so called "address block"
approach, you <b><i>cannot</i></b> use any other address elements, such as City, State, etc. (Note: this approach is not valid for EmployeeAdd/Mod/Query)</li>
</ol>

If you use the address block approach above, the lines Addr1...Addr5 are each printed as a separate line on the transaction, and the values are returned in the Ret object under the aggregate ShipAddressBlock or BillAddressBlock.
