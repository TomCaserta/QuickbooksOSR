<b><i>PayrollDetailReportQuery</i></b><br />
<p>Returns information from any of five QuickBooks payroll reports: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Employee state taxes detail report<br />
  </li>
  <li>Payroll item detail report (lists the payroll transactions on which each 
    payroll item appears)<br />
  </li>
  <li>Payroll detail review report (provides detailed information about how QuickBooks 
    calculates tax amounts on employee paychecks and in year-to-date transactions)<br />
  </li>
  <li>Payroll transaction detail report (shows the line-item detail that appears 
    on each payroll transaction)<br />
  </li>
  <li>Payroll transactions by payee report (lists payroll transactions, grouping 
    them by payee)</li>
</ul>
<p>Payroll Summary Reports can be generated if your application is accessing a company file that is currently signed up for a subscription to a payroll service. (If your application is not signed up, it will receive an error when it attempts to generate a report in this category.) </p>
<p>
The restrictions noted above about payroll reports requiring the use of the Intuit Payroll service do not apply to the QuickBooks sample companies. You can still test out these reports on the sample companies without subscribing to the payroll service. For all other companies, however, the company must be subscribed.</p>
