<b><i>IsPending</i></b><br />
If IsPending is set to true, the transaction in question has not been completed. 
Pending sales might include unpaid orders, estimates, tracked hours that have 
not yet been billed, or sales of back-ordered items. Within QuickBooks, you can 
change the IsPending status for a credit memo, for example, by choosing &#147;Mark 
Credit Memo As Pending&#148; or &#147;Mark Credit Memo As Final&#148; from the 
Edit menu.
