<b><i>MenuText</i></b><br />
The string that appears in the QuickBooks menu: 
<ul>
  <li>If MenuText is within a Submenu, MenuText appears as a subitem nested under 
    your application name. Your application name appears at a predefined location 
    in the QuickBooks menu and is followed by a right arrow that opens your submenu.</li>
  <li>If MenuText is <em>not</em> within a Submenu (that is, if you only have 
    one menu item), MenuText follows your AppName (separated by a colon) at a 
    predefined location in the QuickBooks menu, usually near the bottom. If your 
    application name plus MenuText is more than 50 characters, MenuText will appear 
    as a subitem. </li>
</ul>
