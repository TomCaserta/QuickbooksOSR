<b><i>VehicleMileageAdd</i></b><br />
Adds a VehicleMileage transaction involving the specified vehicle for 
the specified total miles or optionally for the QuickBooks calculated total miles
if you supply the odometer start and end.
<br />
<br />
Notice that only dates are supported for vehicle mileage, so make sure you enter any datetime values with dates only, no time values. That is, 2002-02-02 will work for trip end date or start date, but 2002-02-02T12:20:20 will not work.
<br />
<br />
The mileage contained in this transaction is multiplied by the standard mileage rate 
allowed by the tax authority and entered by the QuickBooks user in the Enter
Vehicle Mileage form. If you're curious to see what this rate currently is, and the
allowable tax expense resulting from this transaction, those are contained in the 
StandardMileageRate and StandardMileageTotalAmount fields in the response to this request.
The Mileage By Vehicle detail and summary reports track this vehicle expense.
<br />
<br />
The customer, item, class reference fields are mainly used if a customer is to be 
charged for mileage, in which case the BillableStatus is set to Billable. In this usage,
customer and item references are required, class is optional. The mileage transaction will
consequently appear as an outstanding billable time and cost charge for the customer when you 
create an invoice for that customer. (If class tracking is turned on in QuickBooks, and you
supply a class in this transaction, the class will automatically appear in the invoice.)
This aspect of the mileage transaction is tracked
in the Mileage By Job detail and summary reports.
<br />
<br />
<b><i>Important: </i></b>currently, only the QuickBooks user can put these outstanding charges
in the invoice. The SDK does not support this.
<br />
<br />
If you specify HasBeenBilled in the BillableStatus field, the transaction shows up as Billed
in the Mileage By Job reports, but not on the list of outstanding billable 
customer time and cost charges when an invoice is created.
