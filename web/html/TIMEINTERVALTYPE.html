<b><i>TIMEINTERVALTYPE</i></b><br />
Time-interval values take the form PT<i>n</i>H<i>n</i>M<i>n</i>S:<br />
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr> 
    <td width="7">&#149;</td>
    <td>The characters P and T are always present.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>&#149;</td>
    <td>The character H follows the number of hours. If the number of hours is 
      0, a sent value does not have to include the H. (A returned value will always 
      include it.)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>&#149;<br /></td>
    <td>The character M follows the number of minutes. If the number of minutes 
      is 0, a sent value does not have to include the M. (A returned value will 
      always include it.)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>&#149;<br /></td>
    <td>The character S follows the number of seconds. If the number of seconds 
      is 0, a sent value does not have to include the S. (A returned value will 
      always include it.)</td>
  </tr>

    <td>&#149;<br /></td>
    <td><i>n</i> is an integer that represents the number of hours, minutes, or 
      seconds. </td>

For SDK v1.0 and v1.1, TIMEINTERVALTYPE does not support seconds, and the format 
is PT<i>n</i>H<i>n</i>M. The following table shows examples of TIMEINTERVALTYPE 
constructs that are valid with SDK v2.0:<br />
<table width="70%" border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
  <tr> 
    <td><b>Valid returned or sent values:</b></td>
    <td><b>Meaning:</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>PT2H30M0S</td>
    <td>2 hours, 30 minutes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>PT2H0M0S</td>
    <td>2 hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>PT0H0M5S</td>
    <td>5 seconds</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><b>Valid sent values:</b></td>
    <td><b>  </b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
