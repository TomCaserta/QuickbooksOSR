<b><i>Account</i></b><br />
  The Account list is the company file&#146;s list of accounts. An AccountRef 
  aggregate refers to one of these accounts. (If an AccountRef aggregate includes 
  both FullName and ListID, FullName will be ignored.)<br />

      the funds are being drawn for this check, for example, Checking or Savings.</li>

    <li>In an <i>ExpenseLineAdd</i> message, you must include AccountRef if the 
      &#147;Require accounts&#148; check box is selected in the QuickBooks Accounting 
      preferences. (It is selected by default.) </li>

    <li>In a <i>CreditCardCredit</i> message, AccountRef refers to the bank account 
      or credit card account to which the credit is applied.</li>
 
    <li>In a <i>CreditCardCharge</i> message, AccountRef refers to the bank or
