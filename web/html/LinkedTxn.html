<p><b><i>LinkedTxn</i></b><br />
If the IncludeLinkedTxns flag is set to true in a query, or if you create an item receipt that links to other transactions, then the returned object will include a list of linked transactions, if any exist. Each linked transaction is represented by a LinkedTxn aggregate. If no linked transactions exist, no LinkedTxn aggregates are returned.<br />
<br />
The list of linked transactions is similar to the History view of a transaction 
in the user interface, but not identical, as the SDK list contains only linked 
transactions, not items. </p>
