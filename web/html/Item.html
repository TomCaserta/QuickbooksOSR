<b><i>ItemRef</i></b><br />
 Depending on the request containing it, ItemRef can refer to an item on any Item list such as ItemDiscount, ItemInventory, and so forth, or it may accept only a subset of item types.
<br />
<br />
For example, here are some requests that impose limits on what items ItemRef can refer to.
<ul>
<li>For PurchaseOrder and Bill requests, ItemRef cannot refer to discount items or sales-tax items</li>
<li>For VehicleMilageAdd requests, the ItemRef must refer to a service item or an other charge item.</li>
<li>For BillingRateAdd requests, the ItemRef must refer to a service item.</li>
</ul>  
You can use an <i>ItemQuery</i> request to get information about all the items that are 
set up in the QuickBooks file. &quot;Items&quot; are line items used for fast entry on sales and 
  purchase forms. They include services and goods that a business buys and sells, 
  as well as special items that perform calculations--for example, subtotal, discount, 
  and sales-tax items.  
<br />
<br />
 <b><i>Note: </i></b>In a request, if an ItemRef aggregate includes both FullName and ListID, FullName 
  will be ignored.
