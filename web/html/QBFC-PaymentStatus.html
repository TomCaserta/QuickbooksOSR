<b><i>PaymentStatus</i></b><br /><br />
Indicates whether the transaction is known to have been successfully processed by the card issuer, with the value "psCompleted" indicating success. That is, there was a response sent to QBMS and from QBMS to the application indicating success. The value "psUnknown" indicates that such a response was not received. If "Unknown" is returned, the transaction may have been successfully or unsuccessfully processed at the card issuer: there simply was no response (possibly due to network errors).
