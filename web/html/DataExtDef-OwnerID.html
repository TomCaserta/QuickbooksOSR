<p><b><i>OwnerID</i></b><br />
OwnerID refers to the owner of a data extension. A value of 0 means the data
extension is a custom field visible and usable within the QuickBooks UI. Any
other non zero value that is a valid GUID means that the data extension is a
private data extension. <br />
  <br />
Usually you would keep your application's GUID confidential to prevent other 
applications from accessing your data extensions. But if you want to share data 
extensions with another application, the applications need to use the same GUID. 
In this case, each application could use two GUIDs, one for shared data extensions 
and one for confidential data extensions. (An application can have any number 
of GUIDs.)<br />
  <br />
  When you share a data extension with another application, the other application 
  must know both the OwnerID and the DataExtName, as these together form a data 
  extension's unique name. </p>
