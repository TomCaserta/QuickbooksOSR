<p><b><i>IsManuallyClosed</i></b><br />
  If IsManuallyClosed is true, this purchase order has been closed, even if all 
  the items have not been received or the sale has not been cancelled. Once the 
  purchase order is marked as closed, all the line items within it become closed 
  as well. You cannot change IsManuallyClosed to false after the purchase order 
  has been fully received.</p>
