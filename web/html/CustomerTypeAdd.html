<p><b><i>CustomerTypeAdd</i></b><br />
  Customer types allow business owners to categorize customers in ways that are 
  meaningful for their businesses. For example, a customer type might indicate 
  which industry a customer represents, or which part of the country a customer 
  is in. </p>
<p>A <i>CustomerTypeRef</i> aggregate refers to one of the types on the CustomerType 
  list. In a request, if a CustomerTypeRef aggregate includes both FullName and ListID, FullName 
  will be ignored. </p>
