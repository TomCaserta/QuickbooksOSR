<b><i>TrackLostEvents</i></b><br />
If you set the TrackLostEvents field in the data event subscription request to 
tleAll, QuickBooks will record DataEventRecoveryTime when the first data event 
  is lost. 
You can check in either of two ways whether any data events have been lost and 
need to be recovered: You can examine the event callback to see whether DataEventRecoveryTime 
is present for any data events, or you can send a DataEventRecoveryInfoQuery request. 
The default is tleNone.
