<p><b><i>TotalBalance</i></b><br />
  The balance for this object and all its subordinate objects. For example, the 
  TotalBalance for XYZ Bank would be the total of the balances of all its subaccounts 
  (checking, savings, and so on). If XYZ Bank did not have any subaccounts, TotalBalance 
  and Balance would be the same. </p>
