<b><i>ConversionRatio</i></b><br />
Within a unit of measure set, in any of the related units in that set, 
this indicates how many base units are in the related unit. That is, if
the base unit is "box", and the related unit is "case" with a conversion ratio
of 10, that means there are 10 boxes in a case.
