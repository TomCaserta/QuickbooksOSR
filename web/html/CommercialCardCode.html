<b><i>CommercialCardCode</i></b><br /><br />
This optional field is used only for Visa and Master Card commercial cards. There are three types 
of these cards: 
purchase, corporate, and business.<br />
<br />
Normally, special lower transaction fee rates apply when these cards are used and this field is filled out. If this field is left blank, then the usual (and higher) discount rate applies.
