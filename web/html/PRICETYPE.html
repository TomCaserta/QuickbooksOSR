<p><b><i>PRICETYPE</i></b><br />
  This data type may use a decimal point but it is not required for QB2009/qbXML 8.0 and later.
  (It is required for older QB/qbXML.) Also, when the SDK returns
  a PRICETYPE value, it will pad the number to two decimal places if necessary.
  For example, 1 would be returned as 1.00.  For QB 2009 and newer, and
  qbXML 8.0 and greater, the maximum allowed
  length of a PRICETYPE value is 15 digits (in 10.5 format). For older QB and
  qbXML spec, the PRICETYPE value is 13 digits (in 8.5 format).</p>
<p><b>About Decimal Values</b><br />
  Decimal values include amounts, quantities, and percents. They can be positive
  or negative. They can include only numeric characters, the + symbol, the - symbol,
  and a decimal point. The + symbol is optional for positive numbers. For decimal
  values, 0 is not the same as a blank because a blank means no value has been
  established. </p>
