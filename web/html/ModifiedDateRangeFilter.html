<b><i>ModifiedDateRangeFilter</i></b><br />
  Filters according to the dates when transactions were last modified. The ModifiedDateRangeFilter 
  aggregate is not required to contain any elements, but if it is empty, we recommend 
  that you leave it out altogether. Note that the time portion of the FromModifiedDate 
  and ToModifiedDate fields was not supported in qbXML version 1.0 or 1.1.<br /><br />
(To filter according to the dates when transactions were <i>deleted</i>, use 
  a TxnDeletedQuery message.)
