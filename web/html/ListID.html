<p><b><i>ListID</i></b><br />
  Along with FullName, ListID is a way to identify a list object. When a list 
  object is added to QuickBooks through the SDK or through the QuickBooks user 
  interface, the server assigns it a ListID. A ListID is not unique across lists, 
  but it is unique across each particular type of list. For example, two customers 
  could not have the same ListID, and a customer could not have the same ListID 
  as an employee (because Customer and Employee are both name lists). But a customer 
  could have the same ListID as a non-inventory item. </p>
