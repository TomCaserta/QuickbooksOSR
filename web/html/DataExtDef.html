<b><i>DataExtDef</i></b><br />
This request adds a data extension definition to the specified object type (e.g. Customer)
so that extension data can be written to a particular object of that type 
(e.g., <i>this</i> customer, John Smith. A data 
extension definition must be created before data can be written to the data extension.<br />
<br />
Notice that a custom field data extension definition can be created either by using DataExtDefAdd
as already described, or via the QuickBooks UI by the user specifying a custom field for
an object. Only
custom fields can be defined through the UI, however, not private data extensions.<br />
<br />
You create a custom field definition by setting the OwnerID to 0. You create a private 
data definition by setting OwnerID to a GUID that only your application owns or shares
with other applications. Custom fields are available and visible within the QuickBooks UI,
whereas private data extensions are seen and used only by your own application or other
applications that know the OwnerID GUID.<br />
<br />
Data can be written to custom fields either via the SDK DataExtAdd/Mod requests or via 
the QuickBooks UI directly by the end user. Data can be written to private data
extensions only via the SDK DataExtAdd/Mod requests. You should be careful not to
use private data extensions in transaction line items because queries will not return
that private data (use only custom fields on transaction line items).<br />
<br />

Notice that creating a custom field data extension definition for Customer and Item
causes an automatic propagation of that definition to certain transaction objects.
See "AssignToObject" for more details. A full description of this behavior and its 
usefulness is provided in the QB SDK Programmer's Guide.<br />

DataExtDefAdd or Mod does not cause any events to be generated
