<b><i>TxnID</i></b><br />
QuickBooks generates a unique TxnID for each transaction that is added to QuickBooks. 
A TxnID returned from a request can be used to refer to the transaction in subsequent 
requests.<br />
<br />
Notice that you cannot supply the TxnID of a TimeTracking transaction to TransactionQueryRq
requests. If you do, you get an error stating that no such record could be found, even though the transaction is in QuickBooks. This behavior reflects the behavior in the QuicKBooks UI in the Find window.
