<b><i>BillPaymentCheckAdd</i></b><br /><br />
A BillPaymentCheckAdd request must include either PaymentAmount, SetCredit, or 
DiscountAmount (or more than one of these). If none of these three is included, 
the SDK will return an error. <br />
<br />
Also, the AppliedToTxnAdd aggregate needs both the TxnID and the payment amount if you are not using the SetCredit sub-aggregate or QuickBooks won't have an amount to apply. If you are using the SetCredit sub-aggregate, you'll need to set the amount in the AppliedAmount field.
<br />
<br />
BillPaymentCheckAdd provides the functionality found in the Pay Bills form in the QuickBooks UI.
You can reach this form by selecting Retail->Pay Bills from the main QuickBooks menubar.
BillPayment is described in detail in the chapter on handling receive payment and
bill payment in the QB SDK Programmer's Guide. Notice that the request requires one (but not more than one!) BillPaymentCheckAdd sub aggregate,
which is provided to support the SDK macro feature in this request. (See the QB SDK Programmer's Guide for more information about macros.) Notice that you can supply only
one of these sub aggregates in the request. If you want to pay multiple bills, you must issue a 
separate request for each bill pay. <br />
<br />
If you are using more than one A/P account, make sure that the APAccountRef in the BillPaymentCheckAdd
matches the APAccountRef that was used when the Bill was originally added. That is, the Bill was
entered in a particular account payable: use that same account payable when you pay the bill using
this request. <br />
Notice that although you can set the IsToBePrinted flag, you cannot print checks using the SDK.<br />
Notice that you set the check number, if desired, using the RefNumber tags.
