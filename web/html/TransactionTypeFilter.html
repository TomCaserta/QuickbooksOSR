<b><i>TransactionTypeFilter</i></b><br /><br />
Filters the transactions based on the transaction's type.  You can specify one or more transaction 
types in the filter. Notice that TimeTracking transactions are not supported. <br />
<br />

If you set the transaction
type filter to "All" (or if you don't set it at all), the query will be searching only those 
transaction types that are permissible types for the user currently logged in. 
 
If instead of "all,"  you specify a transaction type that the currently logged in user is not 
permitted to access, you will get a runtime error, even if other permissible transaction types
were specified as well.
