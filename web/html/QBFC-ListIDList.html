<p><b><i>ListIDList</i></b><br />
  One or more ListID values. Along with FullName, ListID is a way to identify 
  a list object. When a list object is added to QuickBooks through the SDK or 
  through the QuickBooks user interface, the server assigns it a ListID.<br />
  <br />
  A ListID is not unique across lists, but it is unique across each particular 
  type of list. For example, two customers could not have the same ListID, and 
  a customer could not have the same ListID as an employee (because Customer and 
  Employee are both name lists). But a customer could have the same ListID as 
  a non-inventory item. </p>
