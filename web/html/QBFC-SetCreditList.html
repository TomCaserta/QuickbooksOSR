<b><i>SetCreditList</i></b><br />
A list of credits to set. Setting, or applying, a credit means using an available 
credit to lower the balance of a transaction such as an invoice or a bill. (Creating 
a credit, on the other hand, means making a credit available to be applied in 
the future.) <br />
<br />
Notice that if you use a credit (SetCredit) only, in your ReceivePaymentAdd or
BillPaymentCreditCardAdd request, then no transaction ID is created, because, 
from the viewpoint of QuickBooks, there was no transaction. Setting a credit 
merely creates links between existing transactions (for example, 
between a credit memo transaction and an invoice transaction), and no 
information about these links will be returned to you in the response.<br />
<br />
If you need to retrieve which transactions were linked in the SetCredit, for
Bill Payment, you must do a BillQuery and specify IncludeLinkedTxns.
