<b><i>BuildAssemblyAdd</i></b><br />
Adds a build assembly transaction to QuickBooks, where the specified quantity of the 
specified inventory assembly item is built. If there are 
insufficient quantities of items required for the build, you can have the build marked as a pending build by using setting MarkPendingIfRequired to True. (If you don't and theren't enough quantities on hand for the build, this request will fail.)  If successful, this request
results in the decrementing of the quantities on hand amounts of each item used in the build, 
and the incrementing of the on hand quantities of the built assembly item.
<br />
<br />
This request is supported only in Premier and Enterprise.
