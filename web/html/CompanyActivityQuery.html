<p>A CompanyActivityQueryRq request message returns LastRestoreTime (the time 
  when the company file was last restored from a back up), and LastCondenseTime 
  (the time the company file was last condensed). It returns the default date 
  of 1970-01-01 (UTC) for these elements if a restore or condense hasn't happened 
  for this company file. (For example, 1970-01-01 will be represented as 1969-12-31T16:00:00-08:00 
  in a time zone that is eight hours behind UTC.)<b> Note:</b> If you include 
  an explicit end tag in a CompanyActivityQuery request, you will receive an error 
  if there is any space between the opening tag and the end tag. The following 
  table shows valid and invalid ways of constructing this request:</p>
<table width="80%" border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
  <tr> 
    <td>Valid</td>
    <td>&lt;CompanyActivityQueryRq&gt;&lt;/CompanyActivityQueryRq&gt;<br />
      <i>(no space between opening and closing tags)</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Valid</td>
    <td> 
      <p>&lt;CompanyActivityQueryRq /&gt;<br />
        <i>(combined opening and closing tag)</i></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Invalid</td>
    <td>&lt;CompanyActivityQueryRq&gt;<br />
      &lt;/CompanyActivityQueryRq&gt;<br />
      <i>(space between opening and closing tags)</i></td>
  </tr>
</table>
