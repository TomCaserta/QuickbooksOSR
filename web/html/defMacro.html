<p><b><i>defMacro</i></b><br />
  Note that defMacro was introduced with <strong>SDK 2.0</strong>, so it only
  works with 2.0 and higher requests. You can use the defMacro attribute to assign
  a name to the TxnID or TxnListID that this aggregate will return. This way you
  can refer to the transaction by name in a later request. For example, if you
  were using the qbXML API and you defined an invoice add request with the name
  TxnID:RecvPmt1234, as shown below, then you could refer to that invoice by name
  in a later receive payment add request:</p>
<p>&lt;InvoiceAddRq&gt;<br />
      &lt;InvoiceAdd defMacro= &quot;TxnID:RecvPmt1234&quot;&gt;<br />
          . . .<br />
  &lt;ReceivePaymentAddRq&gt;<br />
      &lt;ReceivePaymentAdd&gt;<br />
          . . .<br />
          &lt;TxnID useMacro=&quot;TxnID:RecvPmt1234&quot;/&gt;<br />
          . . .</p>
  <b>If you use macros with QBOE...</b><br />
  There may be a bug in the QBOE implementation of this feature. If this feature is not working for you
  in QBOE, try stripping the prefix "TxnID:" from the name of the useMacro.
   For example, defMacro="TxnID:RecvPmt1234"  and
useMacro="RecvPmt1234"
