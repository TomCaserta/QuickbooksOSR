You can create a workers' comp code with several rates and effective dates, both in the past, present, and future (only one in the future). Each of these dates has a rate associated with it, the idea being you can set up the comp code to support anticipated increases (or decreases) in the rate. The value in this field indicates the first rate that will occur after the current rate andeffective date.
