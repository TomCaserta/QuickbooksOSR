<b><i>CurrencyAdd</i></b><br />
 Creates a user defined currency with the specified name and currency code, both of which will show
 up in the QuickBooks UI. <br />
<br />
Currencies created by users, whether via the UI or via SDK using this request, are distinguished from the built-in QB currencies
in the Currency Ret object: they are identified as user defined. User defined currencies do not get their exchange rates
updated automatically by QuickBooks via the Download Current Exchange Rates feature. You'll always need to manually update
the exchange rates. However, other than this, these type of currencies function within QB in the same way as the
built-in currencies.<br />
<br />
If you have not used a user defined currency in a transaction, you can delete it using ListDel. You cannot delete
the built-in QB currencies.
