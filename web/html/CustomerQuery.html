<b><i>CustomerQuery</i></b><br />
<br />
Returns data for the specified customers.<br />
<br />
<b>Important: </b>We highly recommend that you use the IncludeRetElement tag in your CustomerQuery to include any data you want but do NOT include the ShipAddress data in the Response, unless you need to get the shipping address for a particular customer. Excluding the shipping address data will significantly improve the performance of the CustomerQuery.
