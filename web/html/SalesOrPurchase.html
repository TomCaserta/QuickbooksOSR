<b><i>SalesOrPurchase</i></b><br />
A SalesOrPurchase aggregate is used for items that are meant to be either purchased 
or sold, but not both. For example, a SalesOrPurchase aggregate would be used 
for a non-inventory item that is purchased but not sold, or for a service item 
that is sold but not purchased.
