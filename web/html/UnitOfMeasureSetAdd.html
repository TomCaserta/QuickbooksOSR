Requires the company to be enabled for unit of measure (UOM), either a single unit of measure per item, or multiple units of measure. However, in order to support both single or multiple units per item of measure enablement, you must prefix all UOM set names with "By the", for example, "By the Barrel". Otherwise, the UOM set will not show up in the QuickBooks UI in single UOM per item mode.
