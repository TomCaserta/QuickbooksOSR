<b><i>DeliverOwnEvents</i></b><br /><br />
Specify the value "false" if you don't want your application to receive notification about events your application generated itself. Specify "true" if you want your application to receive notification even about its own generated events.<br />
<br />
If you don't specify anything, by default, the application receives notification about all the subscribed-to events, even those the application generated itself.
