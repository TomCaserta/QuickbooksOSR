<b><i>PaymentMethod</i></b><br />
A customer's payment method, for example, cash, check, or Master Card. A PaymentMethodRef 
aggregate refers to an item on the PaymentMethod list. In a request, if a PaymentMethodRef aggregate 
includes both FullName and ListID, FullName will be ignored. <br />
<br />
In a SalesReceiptAdd, ReceivePaymentAdd, or ARRefundCreditCard request that contains credit card transaction data supplied from QBMS transaction responses, you must specify the payment method, and the payment method must be a credit card type.
