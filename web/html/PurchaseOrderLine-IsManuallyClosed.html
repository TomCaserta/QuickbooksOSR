<p><b><i>IsManuallyClosed</i></b><br />
  If IsManuallyClosed is true, the purchase order line has been closed, even if 
  this item has not been received or its sale cancelled. If all the purchase order 
  lines are marked as closed, the purchase order itself is marked as closed as 
  well. You cannot change IsManuallyClosed to false after the purchase order line 
  has been fully received.</p>
