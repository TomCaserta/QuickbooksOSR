<b><i>LinkToTxnID</i></b><br />
When used with InvoiceAdd, the transaction you are linking to via this field must be a SalesOrder; links to other transactions, such as to estimates, are not currently supported.<br />
<br />
When used with BillAdd or ItemReceiptAdd, the transaction you are linking to via this field must be a PurchaseOrder: links to other transactions are not currently supported.<br />
<br />
The LinkToTxnID aggregate allows you to link to an entire transaction, pulling in all of its line items. 
If you want to pull in only some of the lines from a linked transaction, you would not use this element,
but would instead use the LinkToTxn aggregate within the line item. You can use the LinktoTxnID element along
with the line item LintToTxn aggregate, but they cannot point to the same linked transaction, for example,
they can't both refer to the same purchase order or the same sales order. (That is, the TxnID in the
LinkToTxnID element cannot match any TxnID in any of the LinkToTxn line item aggregates.) If you do this, you'll
get a runtime error.
<br />
<br />
You will get a runtime error if the transaction specified by LinkToTxnID is 
already closed or fully received and the request does not contain any other lines. 
You get error if you attempt to save an empty transaction. You get a warning if you attempt to link 
to a transaction that's already closed.
<br />

For a complete set of rules and instructions on linking transactions, see the chapter on transaction
Linking in the QuickBooks SDK Programmer's Guide.
