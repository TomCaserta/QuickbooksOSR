<b><i>PayrollSummaryQuery</i></b><br />

<p>This report returns information from any of three QuickBooks payroll reports:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Payroll summary report<br />
    This report shows the total wages, taxes withheld, deductions from net pay, 
    additions to net pay, and employer-paid taxes and contributions for each employee 
    on the payroll. <br />
  </li>
  <li>Employee earnings summary report<br />
    This report shows information similar to the payroll summary report, but in 
    a different layout. The report has a row for each employee and a column for 
    each payroll item. <br />
  </li>
  <li>Payroll liability balances report<br />
    This report lists the payroll liabilities the QuickBooks company owes to various 
    agencies, such as the federal government, your state government, insurance 
    plan administrators, labor unions, etc. The report covers unpaid liabilities 
    incurred during the period of time shown in the From and To fields. If the 
    company paid a liability incurred within the date range of the report, the 
    report omits that liability, even if the payment occurred after the ending 
    date of the report. </li>
</ul>
<p>Payroll Summary Reports can be generated if your application is accessing a company file that is currently signed up for a subscription to a payroll service. (If your application is not signed up, it will receive an error when it attempts to generate a report in this category.) </p>
<p>
The restrictions noted above about payroll reports requiring the use of the Intuit Payroll service do not apply to the QuickBooks sample companies. You can still test out these reports on the sample companies without subscribing to the payroll service. For all other companies, however, the company must be subscribed.</p>
