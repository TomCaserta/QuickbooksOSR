<b><i>VendorCredit</i></b><br />
A vendor credit is also known as a "bill credit". That is, it is a credit that <i>a vendor owes you</i> because you overpaid your bill, returned merchandise, or for some other reason.  The VendorCredit is referenced in a BilPayment transaction,  inside the SetCredit aggregate. <br />
<br />
A VendorCredit should not be confused with a Credit Memo, which is used to specify an amount <i>you owe your customer</i> and which is referenced in a ReceivePayment request.
