<b><i>Name</i></b><br />
  The case-insensitive name of a list object, not including the names of its ancestors.
  Name must be unique, unless it is the Name of a &#147;hierarchical&#148; list
  object. List objects in different hierarchies can have duplicate names because
  their FullNames will still be unique. For example, two objects could both have
  the Name kitchen, but they could have unique FullNames, such as
  Job12:kitchen and Baker:kitchen. <br />
  <br />
  For built-in currencies, Name is the internationally accepted currency name and is not editable.
