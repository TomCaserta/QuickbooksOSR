<b><i>TimeLastProcessed</i></b><br /><br />

  <ul> 
   
    <li><b>For data and UI events:</b> TimeLastProcessed will be present if this 
      subscription has been processed by at least one company file. It indicates 
      the last time that this subscription is propagated to a company file.</li>

    <li><b>For UI extensions:</b> TimeLastProcessed indicates when the extension 
      was processed for an installation of QuickBooks (not for a company file, 
      as with events). UI extensions are processed by each installation of QuickBooks 
      the first time QuickBooks is started after a UI extension is added. No additional 
      processing of the subscription is done as data files are opened. (Each data 
      file has to grant access to the extension, but this does not affect the 
      TimeLastProcessed.)</li>
  </ul>
