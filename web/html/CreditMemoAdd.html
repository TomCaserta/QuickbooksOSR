<b><i>CreditMemoAdd</i></b><br />
Adds a credit memo. A credit memo specifies an amount that you owe your customer for some reason, such as overpayment against an invoice, returned merchandise, or for some pre-payment. It reduces a customer&#146;s outstanding balance.  The CreditMemo doesn't actually get applied until  is referenced in a ReceivePayment transaction inside the SetCredit aggregate.<br />
<br />
The CreditMemo should not be confused with a VendorCredit, which specifies an amount that a vendor owes you.<br />
<br />
<b>Using Credit Memos for Pre-Payments </b> <br />
Occasionally an application will need to record pre-payments for a job that is invoiced or paid for only when it is complete. One can create sales receipts for pre-payments using an item other charge named something like "Pre-payment". If the customer will eventually be sent an invoice for the total job, create credit memos for that customer for the pre-payment amount on each sales receipt. If the customer will be paying for the final job when it is completed and will be issued a sales receipt, do not create the credit memos. The credit memos are only used for invoice transactions. <br />
<br />
When the work order is complete add the invoice to QuickBooks and then apply the credit memos with a ReceivePaymentAdd request. The amount due on the invoice will be reduced properly and all of the transactions will be properly recorded in QuickBooks. <br />
<br />

If a sales receipt will be issued at the end of the job, include pre-payment information in multiple lines or as a summary line. Use the description field to list the existing pre-payment sales receipt or receipts so all transactions can be tied together on the final sales receipt.
