<b><i>Vendor</i></b><br />
A vendor is any person or company from whom a small business owner buys goods 
and services. (Banks and tax agencies usually are included on the vendor list.) 
A company's vendor list contains information such as account balance and 
contact information about each vendor. A VendorRef aggregate refers to one of 
the vendors on the list. In a request, if a VendorRef aggregate includes both FullName and ListID, 
FullName will be ignored.
