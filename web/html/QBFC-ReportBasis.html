<b><i>ReportBasis</i></b><br /><br />
If ReportBasis is

  <ul>
    
    <li><em>rbCash</em>, the report bases income and expenses 
      on the dates when money changed hands.</li>

    <li><em>rbAccrual</em>, the report bases income on the dates 
      when customers were invoiced and bases expenses on the dates when bills 
      were entered.</li>
 
    <li><em>rbNone</em>, the report uses the default ReportBasis, 
      which is either the QuickBooks Preference setting or the QuickBooks default 
      for a given type of report. In a report response, the SDK returns rbNone 
      for reports that do not support ReportBasis. (The 1099 report, for example, 
      has its own basis for generation.)</li>
  </ul>
