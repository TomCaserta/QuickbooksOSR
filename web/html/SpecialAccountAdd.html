<p><b><i>SpecialAccountAdd</i></b><br /></p>
<p>
Adds a special account of the specified type to QuickBooks.  A special account is an account normally created automatically as needed within the QuickBooks UI, or in the SDK via
the SpecialAccountAdd request.
Notice that default names for each account type are used, so there is no
provision for a name field here.
</p>
<p>
If a special account of the type you are trying to add already exists in the QuickBooks company, the response will return a warning and the account will not be added. </p>
<p>
Notice that the Ret object for this request is AccountRet. Also, notice that you use AccountQuery to get accounts, including special accounts.
