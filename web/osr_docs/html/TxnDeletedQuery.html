A TxnDeletedQuery will return all transaction elements deleted within the last 
90 days, grouped according to object type. (For example, if the request specifies 
TxnDelType elements of Bill and then Check, it will return all the Bill deletes 
first, then all the Check deletes.) By default, the records are returned in ascending 
order, according to the "real" delete time. For example:<br />
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr> 
    <td width="7">&#149;</td>
    <td>If transaction A is deleted at 10 a.m. and B is deleted at 11 a.m., the 
      query request will return A first, then B.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>&#149;<br />
      <br />
    </td>
    <td>However, if the QuickBooks user moves the clock back before deleting B 
      (for example, B is deleted at 9 a.m.), the query will still return first 
      A then B, because B was deleted after A in "real" time.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
