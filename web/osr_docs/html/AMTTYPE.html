<p><b><i>AMTTYPE</i></b><br />
  AMTTYPE is a decimal value that represents an amount. This data type may use a decimal point followed by two
  decimal values, but it is not required for QB2009/qbXML 8.0 and later.
  (Decimal is required for older QB/qbXML.)  For QB 2009 and newer, and
  qbXML 8.0 and greater, the maximum allowed
  length of a AMTTYPE value is 15 digits (in 10.5 format). For older QB and
  qbXML spec, the AMTTYPE value is 13 digits (in 8.5 format).</p>

<p><b>About Decimal Values</b><br />
  Decimal values include amounts, quantities, and percents. They can be positive
  or negative. They can include only numeric characters, the + symbol, the - symbol,
  and a decimal point. The + symbol is optional for positive numbers. For decimal
  values, 0 is not the same as a blank because a blank means no value has been
  established. </p>
