<p><b><i>PaymentTxnLineID</i></b><br />
  For the PaymentTxnLineID, use a TxnLineID value exactly as it has been returned 
  by the ReceivePaymentToDepositQuery request. If you do not include a PaymentTxnLineID 
  and include a PaymentTxnID for a transaction that includes payment lines, only 
  the first payment line from that transaction will be deposited. </p>
