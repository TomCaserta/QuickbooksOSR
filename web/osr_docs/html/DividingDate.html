<b><i>DividingDate</i></b><br />
The dividing date indicates the fiscal period within which the accountant is working. This date is key because as long
as the accountant copy exists, no transactions can be modified or created within that period. You can add new accounts,
but you cannot add new subaccounts to existing accounts, and you cannot edit, merge, or make an existing account inactive.
Finally, you cannot delete or merge list items.
