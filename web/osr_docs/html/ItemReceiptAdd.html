<b><i>ItemReceiptAdd</i></b><br />
Adds an item receipt transaction, which is a transaction entered in QuickBooks when a shipment is received from a vendor. If you use PurchaseOrders to order from the vendor, you can link the item receipt to purchase order to receive the items against the purchase orders to automatically update (and eventually close) the purchase orders. This linking also saves you having to re-create line items as they are pulled in automatically from the purchase order. You can do this linking only in the item receipt add, not in the mod.
