<b><i>ExchangeRate</i></b><br />
The exchange rate is the market price for which this currency
can be exchanged for the currency used by the QuickBooks company file as the "home" currency.
The exchange rate should be considered a snapshot of the rates in effect at the AsOfDate.<br />
<br />
You can update the exchange rate using the exchange rate property when you add a transaction. However, you need to obtain and
supply the exchange rate. If you are using USD (United States Dollars) as the home currency and are connected to the Internet,
you can download the current exchange rates for all active currencies automatically in the QuickBooks UI by selecting
Lists->Currency->Activities->Download latest exchange rates. (Currently, you can't do this in the SDK.)
