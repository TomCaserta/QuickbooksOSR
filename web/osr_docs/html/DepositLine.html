<p><b><i>DepositLine</i></b><br />
  Each deposit line describes one deposit into the account indicated by DepositToAccountRef. 
  Deposit lines are added as either received payments (described by a PaymentTxnID 
  and possibly a PaymentTxnLineID) <em>or</em> as transfers from one account into 
  another (where at least the AccountRef must be specified).</p>
