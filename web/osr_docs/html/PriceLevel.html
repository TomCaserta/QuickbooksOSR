<b><i>PriceLevel</i></b><br /><br />
You can use price levels to specify custom pricing for specific customers. Once you create a price level for a customer, QuickBooks will automatically use the custom price in new invoices, sales receipts, sales orders or credit memos for that customer. You can override this automatic feature, however, when you create the invoices, sales receipts, etc.) <br /><br />

The user can now specify a price level on line items in the following supported sales transactions: invoices, sales receipts, credit memos, and sales orders.<br /><br /> 

Notice that the response data for the affected sales transaction does not list the price level that was used.  The response simply lists the Rate for the item, which was set using the price level.
