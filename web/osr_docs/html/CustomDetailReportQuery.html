<b><i>CustomDetailReportQuery</i></b><br />
<p>A Custom Transaction Detail report gives you complete control over the content of the report. It does not have any default values and consists entirely of customized data. You must specify all the include columns for the transactions you want returned in the report.</p>

<p>If you want complete control over the report content, you will be interested in both the custom summary report and the custom transaction detail report. Custom reports do not make any assumptions about the data you are interested in--they require you to specify exactly what data you want included in the report. Your application has to select the row and column axes, and it controls the output using common customization parameters for dates and filters. For the custom transaction detail report, you must specify all the include columns for the transactions you want returned in the report. For these reports, you are also required to specify a date element a DateMacro or a custom date range).
