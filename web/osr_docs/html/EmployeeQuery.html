<b><i>EmployeeQuery</i></b><br />
Returns employee data. Notice that prior to qbXML spec 4.0, an EmployeeQueryRq would return a permissions
error if the currently logged in QuickBooks user did not have "Payroll and Employees" permission. This
would occur even if you only needed data that was not restricted.<br />
<br />
However, because of IncludeRetElement (beginning with qbXML spec 4.0), the situation has changed somewhat. You can use
that new element to specify fields in the EmployeeRet object that do not require "Payroll and Employees"
permissions.  Such a query would return the unrestricted data (such as Name) from 
an EmployeeQueryRq even if the logged in user lacks "Payroll and Employees"
permissions.
