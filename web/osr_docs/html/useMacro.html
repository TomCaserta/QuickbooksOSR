<b><i>useMacro</i></b><br />
The useMacro attribute assigns a TxnID or TxnLineID that was named previously
by a defMacro attribute. (Note that defMacro was introduced with <strong>SDK 2.0</strong>,
so it only works with 2.0 and higher requests.) <br />
<br />
<b>If you use macros with QBOE...</b><br />
There may be a bug in the QBOE implementation of this feature. If this feature is not working for you
in QBOE, try stripping the prefix "TxnID:" from the name of the useMacro.
 For example, defMacro="TxnID:RecvPmt1234"  and
useMacro="RecvPmt1234"
