<b><i>ApplyIncomeAccountRefToExistingTxns</i></b><br />
Used to support changing the AccountRef in the Mod request. When you do this, the QuickBooks UI
normally displays a prompt asking whether the change should apply to existing transactions or not. Specifying False basically dismisses this with a "No" answer; specifying True dismisses it with a "Yes" answer and then changes the existing transactions that use the item with that
AccountRef. <br />
<br />
Setting this to "True" should be used with caution and normally only after some user has indicated 
that they want those changes made to all those existing transactions!<br />
<br />
If any affected transactions are protected by a closing date and password, the AccountRef changes will not be made and so the Mod request will return an error without making the requested Mod.
