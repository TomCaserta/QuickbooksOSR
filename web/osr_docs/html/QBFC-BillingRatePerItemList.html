<b><i>BillingRatePerItemRetList</i></b><br /><br />
If you don't use FixedBillingRate to apply your billing rate to all
service items, you need to use the BillingRatePerItemList with at
least one IBillingRatePerItem object appended to it. Each IBillingRatePerItem object
specifies the service item that your billing rate will operate on.  You can append as
many IBillingRatePerItem objects to the list as you want.
