<p>A CompanyQueryRq request message returns detailed information about a QuickBooks 
  company file, such as the company&#146;s address and legal name, certain preferences that are set, and any services that the company is subscribed to, such as payroll, QuickBooks Merchant Services, and so forth. Company information 
  cannot be added or modified through the SDK, only through the QuickBooks user 
  interface.<b> Note:</b> If you include an explicit end tag in a CompanyQueryRq 
  request, you will receive an error if there is any space between the opening 
  tag and the end tag. The following table shows valid and invalid ways of constructing 
  this request:</p>
<table width="80%" border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
  <tr> 
    <td>Valid</td>
    <td>&lt;CompanyQueryRq&gt;&lt;/CompanyQueryRq&gt;<br />
      <i>(no space between opening and closing tags)</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Valid</td>
    <td> 
      <p>&lt;CompanyQueryRq /&gt;<br />
        <i>(combined opening and closing tag)</i></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Invalid</td>
    <td>&lt;CompanyQueryRq&gt;<br />
      &lt;/CompanyQueryRq&gt;<br />
      <i>(space between opening and closing tags)</i></td>
  </tr>
