<b><i>RefNumber</i></b><br />

A string of characters that refers to this transaction and that can be arbitrarily 
changed by the QuickBooks user. <br />
<br />
In a BillPaymentCheckAdd request, if you want to set the check number, use RefNumber.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note (especially relevant to CheckAdd requests): </strong>When RefNumber 
is left blank in an SDK transaction add request (that is, &lt;RefNumber/&gt; or 
&lt;RefNumber&gt;&lt;/RefNumber&gt;), the RefNumber will be left blank in QuickBooks. 
This behavior is new as of QBFC3. It used to select the next sequential reference 
number since the last one used by QuickBooks, as though no RefNumber had been 
provided. This is especially relevant to CheckAdd requests because with the current 
behavior, you will not know the number until the check is printed.
