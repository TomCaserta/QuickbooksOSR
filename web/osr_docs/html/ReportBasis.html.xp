<b><i>ReportBasis</i></b><br />
<ul>
<li>If ReportBasis is Cash, the report bases income and expenses on the dates when money changed hands.</li>
<li>If ReportBasis is Accrual, the report bases income on the dates when customers were invoiced and bases expenses on the dates when bills were entered.</li>
<li>If ReportBasis is None, the report uses the default ReportBasis, which is either the QuickBooks Preference setting or the QuickBooks default for a given type of report. In a report response, the SDK returns None for reports that do not support ReportBasis. (The 1099 report, for example, has its own basis for generation.)</li>
