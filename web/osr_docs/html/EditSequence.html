<p><b><i>EditSequence</i></b><br />
  A number that the server generates and assigns to this object. Every time the 
  object is changed, the server will change its EditSequence value. When you try 
  to modify a list object, you must provide its EditSequence. The server compares 
  the EditSequence you provide with the EditSequence in memory to make sure you 
  are dealing with the latest copy of the object. If you are not, the server will 
  reject the request and return an error. </p>
<p>Because EditSequence is only used to check whether two objects match, there 
  is no reason to interpret its value. </p>
