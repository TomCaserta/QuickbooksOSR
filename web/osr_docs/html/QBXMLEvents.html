<p><b><i>IMPORTANT!: </i></b>You cannot invoke this directly! This is simply the qbXML that is returned to your callback
application.</p>

<p>When a subscribed-to event occurs, your application's callback method receives a
QBXMLEvents message that contains one of three responses (based on the type of
event that occurred): a list of DataEvent aggregates, a UIEvent aggregate, or
a UIExtensionEvent aggregate. For details about the event-notification feature,
see the chapter called &quot;Event Notification&quot; in the <i>QuickBooks SDK Programmer's Guide</i>.</p>
