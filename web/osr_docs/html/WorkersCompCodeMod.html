Requires the company to be subscribed to Intuit Payroll service. Modifies an existing workers' compensation code. Notice that if a future date exists and you write a new one (using the Mod request) then the most recently written code wins.<br />
<br />
You cannot currently assign codes to employees in the SDK. You have to use the UI to do that.
