<b><i>SetCredit</i></b><br />
Setting, or applying, a credit means using an available credit to lower the balance 
of a transaction such as an invoice or a bill. (<i>Creating</i> a credit, on the 
other hand, means making a credit available to be applied in the future.) <br />
<br />
Notice that if you use a credit (SetCredit) only, in your ReceivePaymentAdd or
BillPaymentCreditCardAdd request, then no transaction ID is created, because, 
from the viewpoint of QuickBooks, there was no transaction. Setting a credit 
merely creates links between existing transactions (for example, 
between a credit memo transaction and an invoice transaction), and no 
information about these links will be returned to you in the response.<br />
<br />
If you need to retrieve which transactions were linked in the SetCredit, for
Bill Payment, you must do a BillQuery and specify IncludeLinkedTxns. For more
information, including information on breaking the links (voiding the credit
payment), see the QuickBooks SDK Programmer's Guide chapter on Receiving payments, bill payments, and deposits.
