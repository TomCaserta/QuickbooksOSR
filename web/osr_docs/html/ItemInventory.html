<b><i>ItemInventory</i></b><br />
An inventory item is any merchandise or part that a business purchases, tracks 
as inventory, and then resells. In QuickBooks, information about an inventory 
item is grouped into three categories:<br />

  <ul> 
    <li>Puchase Information includes PurchaseDesc, PurchaseCost, COGSAccountRef, 
      and PrefVendorRef. </li>

    <li>Sales Information includes SalesDesc, SalesPrice, and SalesTaxCodeRef. 
    </li>

    <li>Inventory Information includes AssetAccountRef, ReorderPoint, QuantityOnHand, 
      TotalValue, and InventoryDate. </li>
  </ul>

<b>The Life Cycle of Inventory Items and Effects of Sales and Purchases </b> <br />
The value of inventory is set when an inventory item is created or bought. QuickBooks uses cost averaging and decreases the value of the inventory asset account at the price when the sale is recorded. <br /><br />

So, lets say a company starts carrying widgets as inventory items. First the inventory item must be created in QuickBooks. If the widgets are already in inventory based on a purchase made that will not be recorded in QuickBooks, the user or application would add the inventory item description along with the quantity on hand and the value (total purchase price) of the quantity on hand. <br /><br />

If the purchase is to be recorded in QuickBooks the inventory item would be created with quantity and value of 0 (zero). Then a bill would be added to QB which would increase the inventory quantity and value. Lets say we bought 10 widgets for $100. QuickBooks would then consider each widget to be worth $10. <br /><br />

The next day a customer buys 5 widgets for $20 each. A sales receipt or invoice is created for the purchase, the quantity of widgets is reduced by 5, to 5 and the value is reduced by $50 to $50. The inventory asset account is reduced by $50 and the undeposited funds or accounts receivable account is increased by $100. <br /><br />

It appears that widgets will be a big seller, so the small business owner goes out and buys 10 more widgets. However, the supplier has also noticed a widget buying trend, so he's increased the price to $25 each. So now our quantity is increased from 5 to 15 and the value is increased from $50 to $300, so they are considered to be worth $20 each. <br /><br />

After purchasing the widgets another customer decides to buy 10 widgets but the price has been raised to $50 each. After the sales receipt or invoice is entered, the inventory is reduced to 5 and the value is reduced to $100. The inventory asset account is reduced by $200 and the undeposited funds or accounts receivable account is increased by $500.

<br />
An <i>ItemInventoryRef</i> aggregate refers to an inventory item. In a request, if an ItemInventoryRef 
aggregate includes both FullName and ListID, FullName will be ignored.
