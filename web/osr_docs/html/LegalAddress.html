<b><i>LegalAddress</i></b><br />
LegalAddress and LegalCompanyName are used on a company&#146;s tax forms and pay 
stubs. (Address and CompanyName, on the other hand, are used on invoices, checks, 
and other forms.) If an address request fails, some combination of address fields 
might be too long.
