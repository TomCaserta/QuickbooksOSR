<b><i>IsToBeEmailed</i></b><br /><br />
If this is set to true, at runtime the customer referenced in this transaction will be checked for a valid email
address. If there is no valid email address, the request will fail. If there is a valid email address currently in QuickBooks for the customer, and the request succeeds,
the transaction will be added to QuickBook's list of forms to be emailed, possibly in a batch. 
<br />
<br />
Notice that setting this field to true does not actually perform the emailing. Only the QuickBooks user can
do that from within QuickBooks. This cannot be done from the SDK. Setting this field to false does not prevent the
QuickBooks user from emailing the transaction later. It simply results in the transaction NOT being placed in
the list of transactions to be emailed.
