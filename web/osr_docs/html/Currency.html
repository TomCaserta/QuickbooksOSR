<b><i>Currency</i></b><br />
The currency object contains all of the information needed by QuickBooks to display and use. For built-in currencies,
the name and currency code values are internationally accepted values and thus are not editable. The comma format is editable, as
is the IsActive status. For user-defined currencies, every value in the object is editable including name and currency code.<br />
<br />
When used with PriceLevels, the CurrencyRef should only be used with "per item" price levels.
