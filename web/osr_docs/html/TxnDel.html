<p>Deleting a transaction removes it completely and irreversibly. (Using a TxnVoid 
  request to void a transaction, on the other hand, sets its amount to zero but 
  keeps a record of it in QuickBooks.) </p>
<p>If you try to delete or void a transaction while it is in use, you will get 
  an error. You will also get an error if you try to delete or void a transaction 
  (say a sales receipt) while a <i>linked</i> transaction (such as a deposit) 
  is in use. If you try to delete or void a transaction that was created before 
  the company's closing date, you might or might not get an error, depending on 
  the permissions and passwords that are set in QuickBooks.</p>
<p>The mode in which a QuickBooks company file is open (single-user or multiuser) 
  does not impact your application&#146;s ability to delete transaction objects 
  from it. (List objects can only be deleted if the company file is open in single-user 
  mode.) </p>
