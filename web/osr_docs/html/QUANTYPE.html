<p><b><i>QUANTYPE</i></b><br />
  QUANTYPE is a decimal value that refers to how much of something exists. A decimal
  point is not assumed; for example, a value entered as 1 will be returned as
  1, without a decimal point. For QB 2009 and newer, and
  qbXML 8.0 and greater, the maximum allowed
  length of a QUANTYPE value is 15 digits (in 10.5 format). For older QB and
  qbXML specs, the QUANTYPE value is 13 digits (in 8.5 format).</p>


<p><b>About Decimal Values</b><br />
  Decimal values include amounts, quantities, and percents. They can be positive
  or negative. They can include only numeric characters, the + symbol, the - symbol,
  and a decimal point. The + symbol is optional for positive numbers. For decimal
  values, 0 is not the same as a blank because a blank means no value has been
  established. </p>
