<b><i>DateDrivenTerms</i></b><br />
Date-driven terms show the day of the month by which payment is due and can include 
a discount for early payment. For example, the following date-driven term means 
that payment is due on the 30th of the month, with a 1% discount if payment is 
made by the 10th: 
<blockquote>
1% 10 Net 30</blockquote>
Payments with standard terms, on the other hand, are due within a certain number 
of days.
