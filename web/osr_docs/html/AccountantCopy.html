<b><i>AccountantCopy</i></b><br />
Aggregate containing information about accountant copy.<br />
<br />
An Accountant's Copy is a version of your company file your accountant can use to make changes while
the original company file continues to be used for <i>most</i> normal operations. The key part of the
accountant copy "protocol" is the <i>dividing date</i> which defines the fiscal period within which the
accountant will be working.<br />
<br />
Dividing date is key because there are enforced restrictions against certain types
of operations on data that fall within the fiscal period the accountant is working on.continue to work. The
restrictions are listed below: <br />
<br />

<b>Transactions:</b><br />
You can work only on transactions dated after the dividing date. <br />
<br />
<b>Accounts: </b><br />
<ul>
<li>You can add a new account, but you cannot add a new subaccount to an existing account. </li>
<li>Existing accounts: You cannot edit, merge, or make an existing account inactive. </li>
<li>New accounts: You can edit an account or make any account inactive that you created while your accountant
has the Accountant's Copy. </li>
</ul><br />

<b>Lists (other than Chart of Accounts): </b><br />

<ul>
<li>You can edit, sort, and make list items inactive. </li>
<li>You cannot delete or merge list items. </li>
</ul><br />

<b>Reconciling:</b><br />
<ul>
<li>You can reconcile your accounts while your accountant has an Accountant's Copy. </li>
<li>All reconciliations that include transactions in the current period (after the dividing date) are saved and will not be undone.</li>
<li>To prevent conflicts with your accountant's changes, reconciliations that include transactions dated on or before the
dividing date will be undone when you import your accountant's changes. </li>
<li>If your accountant has reconciled or undone a reconciliation for any period, any reconciliations you did will be
undone when you import your accountant's changes. </li>
</ul>
