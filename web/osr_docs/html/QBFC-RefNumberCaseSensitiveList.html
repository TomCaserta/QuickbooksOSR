<b><i>RefNumberCaseSensitiveList</i></b><br /><br />
A list of one or more case sensitive RefNumber values. A RefNumber is a string of characters 
that refers to a transaction and that can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks 
user. <br /><br />

You should use this case sensitive ref number list rather than the older RefNumber list, because it provides much better performance in certain circumstances. The older refNumber list provided slow performance if the refNumber values contained letters, not just digits. This RefNumberCaseSensitive list, new in SDK 4.0, eliminates this performance hit.
