<b><i>HomeCurrency</i></b><br />
The currency that is set as the home currency for this company file.
The home currency is normally the currency of the country where the business is physically located.<br />
<br />
Although a home currency other than US Dollars can be chosen for the home currency, certain QuickBooks
convenience features are available only with a home currency of US Dollars, such as the ability to download
via a button click in the UI the current exchange rates for all active currencies, which is supported only for
home currency of USD--otherwise you'll have to look up and add the exchange rates yourself. Also,
Intuit services such as payroll and online banking will not be available as these services are only available in US dollars.<br />
<br />

Currently, once the home currency has been set and used in any transaction, it cannot be changed.
