<b><i>ToDeletedDate</i></b><br />
Selects objects deleted on or before this date. Both ToDeletedDate and FromDeletedDate 
must be between 1970-01-01 and 2038-01-19T03:14:07 (2038-01-18T19:14:07-08:00 
PST).<br />
<br />
If ToDeletedDate includes a date but not a time (for example, if you set it to 
2002-02-14), the time is assumed to be the end of the day (2003-02-14T23:59:59). 
If you omit ToDeletedDate altogether, then it will be set to 2038-01-19T03:14:07 
(2038-01-18T19:14:07-08:00 PST).
