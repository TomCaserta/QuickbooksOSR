<b><i>RefNumberRangeFilter</i></b><br />
Filters according to RefNumber. The filtering code will do a numerical comparison (if FromRefNumber and ToRefNumber only contain digits) or a lexicographical comparison (if either FromRefNumber or ToRefNumber contain any nondigit characters). In the first situation, if you need to query for a RefNumber that is larger than the maximum long integer value  of 2147483647, one workaround is to specify a FromRefNumber that is less than or equal to 2147483647 without specifying a ToRefNumber.
