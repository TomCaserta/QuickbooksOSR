<p><b><i>EmployeeAddress</i></b><br />
  If an address request fails, some combination of address fields might be too 
  long. If you use payroll, you must specify the employee&#146;s city, state (or 
  province), ZIP (or postal) code, and at least one line of the street address. 
</p>
<p>(Note that the State element has restrictions when it's used in the EmployeeAddress 
  aggregate. For more information, click State in the table.) </p>
