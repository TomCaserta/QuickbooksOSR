<p><b><i>Estimate</i></b><br />
  A QuickBooks estimate is a description of a sale that the QuickBooks user proposes 
  to make to a current or prospective customer. An estimate might also be called 
  a &quot;bid&quot; or a &quot;proposal.&quot; In QuickBooks, estimates and invoices 
  use similar fields, and an estimate can be converted into an invoice after the 
  customer accepts the estimate. </p>
<p>An estimate is a non-posting transaction, so it does not affect a company&#146;s 
  balance sheet or income statement.</p>
