<b><i>Threshold</i></b><br />
This is the dollar amount at which the IRS requires you to file the 1099-MISC form. Each box ("Category" in SDK lingo) can have a
separate threshold, as established by the IRS. For the latest thresholds, check the website for the Internal Revenue Service, currently
at www.irs.gov.
