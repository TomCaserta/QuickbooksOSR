<b><i>ItemNonInventory</i></b><br />
A non-inventory item is any material or part that a business buys but does not 
keep on hand as inventory. There are two types of non-inventory items:
<ol>
  <li>Materials or parts that are part of the business&#146;s overhead (for example, 
    office supplies).</li>
<li>Materials or parts that the business buys to finish a specific job and then charges 
back to the customer.</li>
</ol>
