<p>Voiding a transaction sets its amount to zero but keeps a record of it in QuickBooks. 
  (Using TxnDel to delete a transaction, on the other hand, removes the transaction 
  completely.) </p>
<p>If you try to void or delete a transaction while it is in use, you will get 
  an error. You will also get an error if you try to void or delete a transaction 
  (say a sales receipt) while a <i>linked</i> transaction (such as a deposit) 
  is in use. If you try to void or delete a transaction that was created before 
  the company's closing date, you might or might not get an error, depending on 
  the permissions and passwords that are set in QuickBooks.</p>
<p>The mode in which a QuickBooks company file is open (single-user or multiuser) 
  does not impact your application&#146;s ability to void transaction objects 
  in it. </p>
