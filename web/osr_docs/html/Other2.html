<b><i>Other2</i></b><br /><br />
Other, Other1, and Other2 are standard QuickBooks custom fields available to transactions. 
The Other field is a transaction-level field, like the FOB field, PO Number field, and so forth.
This field appears only once for the transaction: you can write to it and modify it. 
<br />
<br />
The Other1 and Other2 fields exist at the line item level; each line item has them, and
you can write or modify the value in each line.
<br />
<br />
These custom
fields are available for immediate use: you don't need to enable these in the transaction template 
to be able to access them via SDK. (However, those Other, Other1, Other2 fields and their values
are <b><i>viewable </i></b>and <b><i>printable </i></b>in QuickBooks only if the transaction template has these enabled!) 
<br />
<br /><b>Note: </b>you cannot use DataExtDef to define Other, Other1, Other2 for the transaction. 
There is no need to in any case. Those are automatically available.
<br />
<br />
Notice that the Other, Other1, and Other2 names are the real SDK names for those custom fields: that is, their 
DataExtName value will always be Other, Other1, or Other2. Even if the user has re-labelled those custom fields 
to something else, such as "Barracks Number", or "Max Headroom", or even "Pleni Potentiary". 
This re-labelling has no effect on the SDK. You'll always write to them or 
modify them as Other, Other1, or Other2.
