<b><i>EarningsList</i></b><br />
A list of IEarnings aggregate objects. If an EmployeeMod request does not include 
any IEarnings objects, the earnings table for that employee will not change. 
If EmployeeMod includes at least one IEarnings object, all existing earnings 
information will be deleted for that employee, and all the earnings information 
in the -Mod request will be added. 
<p>(To delete all the earnings information, set the ClearEarnings field to true 
  in an EmployeeMod request.) <br />
