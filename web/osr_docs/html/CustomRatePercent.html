<b><i>CustomRatePercent</i></b><br /><br />
Using this field with BillingRateAdd will work only if the service item itself is set to a percentage, not to an amount. If you attempt to set the Billing Rate to a percentage for a service item that has an amount for the Rate, you will get an error. <br />
<br />
The kind of rate you have on the service item determines the kind of billing rate you may have on that item.
