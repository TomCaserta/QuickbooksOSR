<b><i>SalesTaxCode</i></b><br />
  Each item on a sales form is assigned a sales-tax code that indicates whether 
  the item is taxable or non-taxable, and why. Two general codes, which can be 
  modified but not deleted, appear on the sales-tax code list by default:<br />

  <ul> 
    
    <li>Non-taxable (Name = NON; Desc = Non-Taxable; IsTaxable = false)</li>

    <li>Taxable (Name = TAX; Desc = Taxable; IsTaxable = true)</li>
  </ul>

  A sales-tax code can be deleted only if it is no longer associated with any 
customer, item, or transaction. If the &quot;Do You Charge Sales Tax?&quot; preference 
within QuickBooks is set to No, QuickBooks will assign the default non-taxable 
sales-tax code to all sales.<br />
<br /> 
A <i>SalesTaxCodeRef</i> aggregate refers to a sales-tax code on the list. 
  In a request, if a SalesTaxCodeRef aggregate includes both FullName and ListID, FullName will 
  be ignored. In a <i>Customer</i> message, SalesTaxCodeRef refers to the sales-tax 
  code that will be used for items related to this customer. In an <i>ItemInventory</i> 
  message, SalesTaxCodeRef refers to the type of sales tax that will be charged 
  for this item, if it is a taxable item and if sales tax is set up within QuickBooks.
