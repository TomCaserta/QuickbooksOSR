<b><i>Customer</i></b><br />
  The customer list includes information about the QuickBooks user's customers 
  and the individual jobs that are being performed for them. A CustomerRef aggregate 
  refers to one of the customers (or customer jobs) on the list. In a request, 
  if a CustomerRef aggregate includes both FullName and ListID, FullName will 
  be ignored.
  Special cases to note:<br />

  <ul> 
    <li>In <i>SalesReceipt</i> and <i>ReceivePayment</i> requests, CustomerRef 
      refers to the customer or customer job to which the payment is credited.</li>

    <li>In a <i>TimeTracking</i> request, CustomerRef refers to the customer or 
      customer job to which this time could be billed. If IsBillable is set to 
      true, CustomerRef is required in TimeTrackingAdd. </li>
 
    <li>In an <i>ExpenseLineAdd</i> request, if AccountRef refers to an A/P account, 
      CustomerRef must refer to a vendor (not to a customer). If AccountRef refers 
      to any other type of account, the CustomerRef must refer to a customer. 
    </li>
  </ul>
