<b><i>TxnIDList</i></b><br />
One or more TxnID values. QuickBooks generates a unique TxnID for each transaction that is added to 
QuickBooks.<br />
<br />
Notice that you cannot supply the TxnID of a TimeTracking transaction to TransactionQuery requests. If you do, you get an error stating that no such record could be found, even though the transaction is in QuickBooks. This behavior reflects the behavior in the QuicKBooks UI in the Find window.
