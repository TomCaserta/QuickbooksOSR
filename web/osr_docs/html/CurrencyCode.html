<b><i>CurrencyCode</i></b><br />
For built-in currencies, the currency code and name is the generally accepted
code and name. These are based on the standard ISO 4217 code/name for a
country's currency. In most cases, the currency code is composed of the country's
two-character Internet country code plus an extra character representing
the currency unit. (Hence the code for Belize Dollars is simply Belize' two-character
Internet code ("BZ") plus a one-character currency designator ("D").<br />
<br />
For user defined currencies, if possible, this nomenclature could be followed but it is
not required.
