<b><i>JournalEntryQuery</i></b><br />
In traditional accounting, transactions are entered into the general journal and 
categorized exclusively by account. In QuickBooks, most transactions can be categorized 
either by account or by type (invoice, check, and so on). For a few activities 
in QuickBooks, you must use the general journal directly, for example for recording 
depreciation.<br />
<br />
Notice that you must supply the credit line and a corresponding debit line in the same request.
 It will not work to supply them in two distinct requests. You can supply as many credit lines and 
debit lines in one single request as you want so long as the total monetary amount from the credits 
equals the total monetary amount from the debits in that request.<br />
<br />
Finally, DO NOT supply negative sign for the monetary amounts. QuickBooks does that for you. If 
you do supply the negative sign amounts will add instead of cancel and you'll get a runtime error.<br />
<br />
<b>Querying for Condensed Transactions</b><br /><br />
If you need the query to return condensed transactions, you can do this by using either an Entity
or Account filter in the journal query request. Alternatively, you could use the The generic
TransactionQuery, which can return condensed transactions.
