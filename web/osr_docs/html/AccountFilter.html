<b><i>AccountFilter</i></b><br />
Filters according to the account name or ListID. If the &quot;Use account numbers&quot; 
preference is enabled in the QuickBooks company file, you can specify an account 
number (instead of an account name) for FullName and get the account you're looking 
for. <br />
<br />
But if numbers have been used as account <em>names</em>, confusion could arise. 
For example, if you queried for an account named 2050, and 2050 happened to be 
the account number of a totally different account, the query would not return 
what you asked for (the account named 2050), but instead would return the account 
with the account number 2050.<br />
<br />
This problem will not happen if
  <ul> 
    <li>the &quot;Use account numbers&quot; preference is turned off in the QuickBooks 
      file, or</li>

    <li>the account name exactly matches the account number. (In this case, query 
      would return the correct account either way.)</li>
</ul>

To avoid this problem:
<ul>

    <li>Do not name an account using a number unless the number exactly matches 
      the account&#146;s account number. </li>
 
    <li>If an account name must contain a number that does not match its own account 
      number, have the QuickBooks user change the account&#146;s name slightly, 
      for example to 2050a. </li>
  </ul>
