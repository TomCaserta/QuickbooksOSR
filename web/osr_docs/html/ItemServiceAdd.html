<p><b><i>ItemServiceAdd</i></b><br />
  Adds a service item, which is an item that refers to services that a business charges for or purchases. 
  Examples include specialized labor, consulting hours, and professional fees. 
  An <i>ItemServiceRef</i> aggregate refers to an item on the ItemService list. 
  In a request, if an ItemServiceRef aggregate includes both FullName and ListID, FullName will 
  be ignored. </p>
<p>In a <i>TimeTracking</i> message, ItemServiceRef refers to the type of work. 
  If no CustomerRef is specified, then ItemServiceRef is not needed. If IsBillable 
  is set to true, then TimeTrackingAdd must include both ItemServiceRef and CustomerRef.
