<b><i>DataExtAdd</i></b><br />
Writes data to <i>one</i> data extension.<br />
<br />
This request can only be invoked if a data extension definition has already been defined 
for the target object type. That is, before you can perform the DataExtAdd
on a particular customer, say John Henry, the data extension must already be defined for 
the Customer object. Notice
that a data extension definition can be defined in either of two ways: via DataExtDefAdd
as already described, or via the QuickBooks UI by the user specifying a custom field. Only
custom fields can be defined through the UI, not private data extensions.<br />
<br />
DataExtAdd adds a custom field (if OwnerID is set to 0) or a private data extension 
(if OwnerID is set to a GUID) containing the specified value. The custom field or 
private data extension and value is added to the specified list object, or 
transaction, or transaction line item.<br />
<br />
DataExtAdd will return error 3180 if you invoke this on a custom data ext definition
that has been deleted and then re-added from the UI. (You can't re-add a deleted data 
ext def via the SDK.)  However, you can use DataExtMod to write data to that re-added
data ext def.<br />
<br />
<b>Important:</b> If you want to perform a DataExtAdd on a transaction line item, you should use custom
fields instead of private data extensions because only custom field data will be returned
in queries. Currently, private data is not returned.<br />
<br />
Both DataExtAdd and DataExtMod cause a Modify event to be generated for the parent object.
For example invoking one of these on a Customer causes a Customer Modify event. The Time Modified
value for that parent object is also updated.
