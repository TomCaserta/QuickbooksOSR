<b><i>VehicleMileage</i></b><br /><br />
A VehicleMileage transaction is used to track tax-related vehicle mileage expenses and optionally also
to bill customers for mileage charges. <br />
<br />
Notice that only dates are supported for vehicle mileage, so make sure you enter any datetime values with dates only, no time values. That is, 2002-02-02 will work for trip end date or start date, but 2002-02-02T12:20:20 will not work.
