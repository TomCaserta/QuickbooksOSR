<b><i>ItemQuery</i></b><br />
This is a general query to search through all the items, of every type, in contrast to the type-specific queries such as ItemInventoryQuery, ItemOtherChargeQuery, and so forth.  ItemQuery will return information about all the items that are set up in the QuickBooks file.  However, if you want to find out if an inventory item  has had its on hand quantity modified by other QB transactions (such as ItemReceipt), then you cannot use this query!  You must use the ItemInventoryQuery instead.<br />
<br />
Notice that you cannot get an inventory asset value from QuickBooks using this query. Instead, you need to use the General Summary Report query (which currently doesn't include Assembly Items). <br />
<br />
Suppose you needed a way to search for the amount on hand of items that have had their amount changed since a certain date.  Again, you would not use this query, but a GeneralDetailReportQuery that has its GeneralDetailReportType set to "InventoryValuationDetail."  This will tell you which items changed by how much. <br />
<br />
Finally, suppose you wanted the on-hand quantity from QB as of a specific date. You would use a General Summary Report of the type Inventory Valuation Summary. (Again, this report doesn't include Inventory Assemblies.)
