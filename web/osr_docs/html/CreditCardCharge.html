<p><b><i>CreditCardCharge</i></b><br />
  A credit card charge is a general charge incurred when a QuickBooks user makes 
  a purchase. Credit card charges for purchases can be tracked as expenses (in 
  expense accounts) or as items.</p>
<p>The current balance on the credit card becomes part of the accounts payable 
  balance. If a balance is carried on the credit card across time, finance or 
  interest charges can be tracked in QuickBooks. </p>
