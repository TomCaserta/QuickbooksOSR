<p><b><i>IsMarkedToBePrinted</i></b><br />
  If IsMarkedToBePrinted is true, all newly created finance-charge invoices will 
  be marked &#147;To be printed.&#148; (This makes it easier for the QuickBooks 
  user to print a selection of invoices all at once.) This preference is set by 
  the QuickBooks user, and has a default value within QuickBooks of false.</p>
<p>Whether IsMarkedToBePrinted is true or false in the FinanceChargePreferences 
  aggregate, the QuickBooks user can still change this preference for each individual 
  invoice.</p>
