<b><i>TaxForm</i></b><br />
The tax form that the QuickBooks user expects to file for this company's taxes. 
If a TaxForm value is assigned (that is, if it is not OtherOrNone), the QuickBooks 
user can associate each account with a tax form line. (An account's tax form line 
information will show up in the response from an account query.)
