<p><b><i>DataEventRecoveryInfo</i></b><br />
  You can use the DataEventRecoveryInfoQuery request to find out whether data 
  event recovery information exists for the given subscriber. If it does, then 
  data events have been lost and need to be recovered. (Note that there will be 
  no data event recovery information to return if TrackLostEvents was &quot;tleNone&quot; 
  in the subscriber's DataEventSubscriptionAdd request.) <br />
  <br />
  Returned data event recovery information currently consists only of DataEventRecoveryTime. 
  For more details about the event-notification feature, see the chapter called 
  &quot;Event Notification&quot; in the <i>QB SDK Programmer's Guide</i>.</p>
