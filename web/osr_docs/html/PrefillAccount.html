<b><i>PrefillAccount</i></b><br />
In vendor-related transactions such as BillPay, you specify the QuickBooks accounts to be used to track the expense
in the expense line items, which in the UI are located in the Expense tab for the transaction. This account pre-fill
feature allows you to specify up to three accounts that will be filled in automatically for these transactions for this
vendor, saving time and reducing the errors that can occur if the wrong accounts are specified.
