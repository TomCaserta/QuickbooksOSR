<b><i>ItemFilter</i></b><br />
Filters according to the item name or ID. You can use an <i>ItemQuery</i> request to get information about all the items that are set up in the QuickBooks file. &quot;Items&quot; are line items used for fast entry on sales and 
  purchase forms. They include services and goods that a business buys and sells, 
  as well as special items that perform calculations--for example, subtotal, discount, 
  and sales-tax items.
