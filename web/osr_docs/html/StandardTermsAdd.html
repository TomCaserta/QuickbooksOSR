<b><i>StandardTermsAdd</i></b><br />
Adds a standard term. Standard terms show the number of days within which payment is due and can include 
a discount for early payment. For example, the following standard term means that 
payment is due in 30 days, with a 1% discount if payment is made within 10 days: 
<blockquote>
1% 10 Net 30</blockquote>
Payments with date-driven terms, on the other hand, are due by a certain date.
