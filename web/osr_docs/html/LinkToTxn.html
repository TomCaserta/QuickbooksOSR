<b><i>LinkToTxn</i></b><br /><br />
When used with InvoiceAdd, the transaction you are linking to via this field must be a SalesOrder; links to other transactions, such as to estimates, are not currently supported.<br />
<br />
When used with BillAdd or ItemReceiptAdd, the transaction you are linking to via this field must be a PurchaseOrder: links to other transactions are not currently supported.<br />
<br />

The LinkToTxn aggregate allows you to bring in a specific line item from a transaction. If you want to link 
an entire transaction and bring in all its lines, use the LinkToTxnID aggregate. Notice that if you use LinkToTxn
in the item line, you cannot use ItemRef in that line: you'll get a runtime error. LinkToTxn brings in all the 
item information you need. (You can, however, specify whatever quantity or rate that you want, or any other
item line element other than ItemRef.<br />
<br />
You can use both LinkToTxnID and LinkToTxn in the same request, as long as these
do NOT link to the same TxnID. You get an error if the transaction specified by LinkToTxnID is 
already closed or fully received and the request does not contain any other lines. 
You get error if you attempt to save an empty transaction. You get a warning if you attempt to link 
to a transaction that's already closed.<br />
<br />

For a complete set of rules and instructions on transaction linking, see the chapter on transaction
linking in the QuickBooks SDK Programmer's Guide.
