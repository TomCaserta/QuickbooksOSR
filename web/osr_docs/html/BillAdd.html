Note: in some editions, such as Enterprise, some Bill-related preference settings can require the use of transaction dates, which means the TxnDates must be supplied, even though they are listed in the OSR as optional!<br />

<p>This message provides the functionality of the QuickBooks "Enter Bills" form, which is used when
the QuickBooks user owes money to a vendor, either through expenses incurred by the vendor (specified
in the Expenses tab within the Enter Bills form, or through receiving items (specified in the Items
tab within the Enter Bills form. When a bill is added, QuickBooks enters the billed amount into
the AccountsPayable register.</p>

<p>The Enter Bills form can be reached in the QuickBooks UI by selecting Vendors->Enter Bills, or by 
clicking on the Bill icon on the main menubar. Notice that the ExpenseLineAdd aggregate maps to a
line item inside the Expense tab in the Enter Bills form, and the ItemLineAdd aggregate maps to 
a line item inside the Item tab.
</p>

<p>If you are receiving items against one or more open PurchaseOrders for the vendor, you can use
the LinkToTxnID element (links in all line items from a PurchaseOrder) and/or the LinkToTxn
aggregate within a line item (links in a specific PurchaseOrder line item). See the chapter on handling receive payment and bill payment in the QB SDK Programmer's Guide for complete details and rules.

<b>The Life Cycle of Inventory Items and Effects of Sales and Purchases </b> <br />
The value of inventory is set when an inventory item is created or bought. QuickBooks uses cost averaging and decreases the value of the inventory asset account at the price when the sale is recorded. <br /><br />

So, lets say a company starts carrying widgets as inventory items. First the inventory item must be created in QuickBooks. If the widgets are already in inventory based on a purchase made that will not be recorded in QuickBooks, the user or application would add the inventory item description along with the quantity on hand and the value (total purchase price) of the quantity on hand. <br /><br />

If the purchase is to be recorded in QuickBooks the inventory item would be created with quantity and value of 0 (zero). Then a <b>bill</b> would be added to QB which would increase the inventory quantity and value. Lets say we bought 10 widgets for $100. QuickBooks would then consider each widget to be worth $10. <br /><br />

The next day a customer buys 5 widgets for $20 each. A sales receipt or invoice is created for the purchase, the quantity of widgets is reduced by 5, to 5 and the value is reduced by $50 to $50. The inventory asset account is reduced by $50 and the undeposited funds or accounts receivable account is increased by $100. <br /><br />

It appears that widgets will be a big seller, so the small business owner goes out and buys 10 more widgets. However, the supplier has also noticed a widget buying trend, so he's increased the price to $25 each. So now our quantity is increased from 5 to 15 and the value is increased from $50 to $300, so they are considered to be worth $20 each. <br /><br />

After purchasing the widgets another customer decides to buy 10 widgets but the price has been raised to $50 each. After the sales receipt or invoice is entered, the inventory is reduced to 5 and the value is reduced to $100. The inventory asset account is reduced by $200 and the undeposited funds or accounts receivable account is increased by $500.
