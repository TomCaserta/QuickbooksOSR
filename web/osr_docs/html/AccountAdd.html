<b><i>AccountAdd</i></b><br />
<br />
This message allows you to perform the same activities as a user does in the QB New Account form, 
which can be accessed in QB by selecting Lists->Chart of Accounts->Accounts->New.<br />
<br />
If you want the account to be a subaccount to an existing account, similar to using the SubAccount 
checkbox and selection list drop down in the New Account form, you use the ParentRef aggregate.
Notice that the ParentRef can take either the parent account's ListID or FullName. It is important
to note that the parent account specified in the ParentRef must have the same account type (AccountType) of 
the child account that you are creating. (The AccountType field maps to the Type pulldown menu in the 
New Accounts field.) <br />
<br />
The AccountNumber is NOT the account number assigned by your bank or other entity. (That number is 
specified in the BankNumber field.) The account number is simply part of a numbering scheme
used by accounting systems to help provide a visual hierarchy and ordering of all of the accounts 
in a Chart of Accounts. QuickBooks provides this functionality for those who need or want it, 
but by default has this functionality turned off.<br />
<br />
The AccountNumber field maps to the Number field in the New
Account form, which appears only if the Accounting preferences for the company have been set to 
use account numbering. By default, account numbers are not used.
In the SDK, you can set the account numbers if you want, even if the preference for it has been
turned off. The numbers would then appear later if the user turned this preference on.<br />
<br />
In the OpenBalance field for certain types of new Accounts, you may want to leave the opening balance
at 0 if you are going to fund the account from another account. That process will effectively 
create the opening balance.<br />
