<p><b><i>IsAutoApply</i></b><br />
  If IsAutoApply is true, QuickBooks applies TotalAmount to any outstanding transaction 
  that exactly matches TotalAmount. If no exact match is found, the payment is 
  applied to the customer job&#146;s outstanding transactions, beginning with 
  the oldest one.</p>
<p>If IsAutoApply is false, QuickBooks receives the payment but does not apply 
  it to any outstanding transaction. Instead, the amount will appear as a credit 
  on the customer job&#146;s next transaction. </p>
