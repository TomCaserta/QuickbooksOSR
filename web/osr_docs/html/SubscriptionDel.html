<p>Deletes all subscriptions that (a) match the specified SubscriberID, and (b) were originally created
using the same qbXML spec version as the one used to make the subscription delete request. That is, if you make a qbXML 4.0
subscription delete, you will only delete subscriptions with the specified SubscriberID that were originally made with qbXML 4.0!
To delete subscriptions made with qbXML 5.0,
your subscription delete must itself use qbXML 5.0.</p>
<p>The subscriberID you supply to this request is the one that was used to make the original
event subscription, and which should have been written down by the person who made the subscription. (There is no way to get
the SubscriberID if you don't already know it.)</p>

<p> For details about the UI-extension feature, see the chapter called &quot;Integrating
with the QuickBooks UI&quot; in the <i>QuickBooks SDK Programmer's Guide.</i> </p>

<p>This request must be invoked using the request processor method ProcessSubscription(), if you use qbXML.

If you use QBFC, this request must be appended to an ISubscriptionMsgSetRequest object instantiated by the
QBSessionManager method CreateSubscriptionMsgSetRequest() and invoked by the method DoSubscriptionRequests().</p>
