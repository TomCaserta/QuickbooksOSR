This value is returned by QBMS from the transaction request, and is used internally by the QuickBooks/QBMS Recon (reconcile) feature. You should save this value without modification and include it in the QB SDK SalesReceiptAdd or ReceivePaymentAdd requests if you want to save the transaction data in QuickBooks.
