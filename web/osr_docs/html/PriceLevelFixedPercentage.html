<b><i>PriceLevelFixedPercentage</i></b><br /><br />
When you create a price level, you must specify whether it is a fixed percentage or a per item price level. Once you create the price level, you cannot change this. QuickBooks Pro and greater versions support fixed percentages, but only QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise support the per item price level.<br />
<br />
Where is this discount applied if Price Levels are enabled in QuickBooks preferences? The discount is applied to the sales price of the item. If the price level is applied to a customer, it automatically adjusts the 
Rate and Amount columns for applicable line items in a QuickBooks Sales Order form, Invoice form, etc. for that customer. The QuickBooks user could still select a different price level. However, the customer price level simply establishes a default price.<br />
<br />
If no price level is applied to the customer, then the QuickBooks user can apply a price level by clicking
the dropdown list of price levels that appears next to the Rate column. The default in this case is simply 
the sales price established for the item. 
<br />
<br />
Notice that this value supports both positive and negative values. For example, a value of 20 would 
increase the price by 20%  and value of -10 would decrease the price by 10%.
