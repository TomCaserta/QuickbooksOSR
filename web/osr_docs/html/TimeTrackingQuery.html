<b><i>TimeTrackingQuery</i></b><br />

The time-tracking transactions that are returned in this query include time tracking information that was entered into QuickBooks manually or gathered using the QuickBooks &#147;Timer&#148; or &#147;Stopwatch.&#148; <br />
<br />
Note that the QuickBooks Timer application can run on its own without QuickBooks, 
  but the QuickBooks SDK cannot access the Timer data directly. The Timer data 
  must be imported into QuickBooks before it is accessible via the SDK.)
