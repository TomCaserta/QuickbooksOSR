<b><i>BillPaymentCreditCardAdd</i></b><br />
A BillPaymentCreditCardAdd request must include either PaymentAmount, SetCredit, 
or DiscountAmount (or more than one of these). If none of these three is included, 
the SDK will return an error. <br />
<br />
BillPaymentCreditCardAdd provides functionality found in the Pay Bills form in the QuickBooks UI.
You can reach this form by selecting Retail->Pay Bills from the main QuickBooks menubar.
BillPayment is described in detail in the chapter on handling receive payment and
bill payment in the QB SDK Programmer's Guide. Notice that the request requires one (but not more than one!) BillPaymentCreditCardAdd 
sub aggregate, which is provided to support the SDK macro feature in this request. (See the 
QB SDK Programmer's Guide for more information about macros.) Notice that you can supply only
one of these sub aggregates in the request. If you want to pay multiple bills, you must issue a 
separate request for each bill pay. <br />
<br />
If you are using more than one A/P account, make sure that the APAccountRef in the BillPaymentCreditCardAdd
matches the APAccountRef that was used when the Bill was originally added. That is, the Bill was
entered in a particular account payable: use that same account payable when you pay the bill using
this request. Notice that although you can set the IsToBePrinted flag, you cannot print checks 
using the SDK.<br />
<br /> 
Finally, notice that it is possible to issue this request using only SetCredit to apply an existing
credit to the bill. However, if you do this, you should be aware that no transaction ID is generated.
The credit and the bill simply are linked. See the QB SDK Programmer's Guide for details.
