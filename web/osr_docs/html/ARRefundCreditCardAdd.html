<b><i>ARRefundCreditCardAdd</i></b><br />
Adds a credit card refund transaction that is linked to one or more QuickBooks credit memo transactions.
You can link the credit card refund to one or more of those credit transactions.<br />
<br />
Notice that this provides functionality over and above what the UI provides, which currently allows a user to link only one credit card refund to one credit transaction.
