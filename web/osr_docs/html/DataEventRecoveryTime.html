<p><b><i>DataEventRecoveryTime</i></b><br />
  The time when the callback application starts losing data events. QuickBooks 
  will not track any DataEventRecoveryTime information for a callback application 
  unless TrackLostEvents was set to All in its subscription. The application can 
  recover from lost data events and get data changes it missed by sending query 
  requests with the time given by DataEventRecoveryTime as part of the time range 
  filter. For example, an application can use this time as the FromModifiedDate 
  and the FromDeletedDate to get missing added, changed, and deleted data. </p>
