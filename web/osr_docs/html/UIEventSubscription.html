<b><i>UIEventSubscription</i></b><br />
<p>Subscribes the specified application to receive notification about UI events, such as the company file opening or
closing. Subsequent to this subscription, your application will receive
the subscribed-to events, which are returned to your callback in a QBXMLEvents message. Make sure you record the
SubscriberID because you'll need it to remove the subscription later, using the SubscriptionDel message.
To delete a subscription, use the SubscriptionDel message. </p>

<p>Be aware that the qbXML version used to subscribe to an event must be used in subsequent subscription queries. That is, if you
construct a subscription query using qbXML 4.0, and then do a subscription query using qbXML 5.0, your 4.0 subscription will
not be returned in the query.</p>

<p>This request must be invoked using the request processor method ProcessSubscription(), if you use qbXML.

If you use QBFC, this request must be appended to an ISubscriptionMsgSetRequest object instantiated by the
QBSessionManager method CreateSubscriptionMsgSetRequest() and invoked by the method DoSubscriptionRequests().</p>

For details about the event-notification
feature, see the chapter called &quot;Event Notification&quot; and the one called
&quot;Integrating
with the QuickBooks UI&quot; in the QB SDK <i>Programmer's Guide</i>.
