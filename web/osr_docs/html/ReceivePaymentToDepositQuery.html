<p>This query returns information about payments that have been received and are 
  ready to deposit. You can use any returned TxnID and TxnLineID elements as PaymentTxnID 
  and PaymentTxnLineID elements in subsequent DespositAdd requests. <b>Note:</b> 
  If you include an explicit end tag in a ReceivePaymentToDepositQuery request, 
  you will receive an error if there is any space between the opening tag and 
  the end tag. The following table shows valid and invalid ways of constructing 
  this request:</p>
<table width="90%" border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
  <tr> 
    <td>Valid</td>
    <td>&lt;ReceivePaymentToDepositQueryRq&gt;&lt;/ReceivePaymentToDepositQueryRq&gt;<br />
      <i>(no space between opening and closing tags)</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Valid</td>
    <td> 
      <p>&lt;ReceivePaymentToDepositQueryRq /&gt;<br />
        <i>(combined opening and closing tag)</i></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Invalid</td>
    <td>&lt;ReceivePaymentToDepositQueryRq&gt;<br />
      &lt;/ReceivePaymentToDepositQueryRq&gt;<br />
      <i>(space between opening and closing tags)</i></td>
  </tr>
