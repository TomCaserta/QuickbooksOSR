<b><i>ItemPayment</i></b><br />
A payment item is used when a partial payment is received at or before the time 
an invoice or statement is created. The payment item then reduces the amount owed 
on an invoice. (If full payment is received at the time of the sale, use a sales 
receipt instead of an invoice.)
