<b><i>CurrentWindow</i></b><br /><br />
The CurrentWindow aggregate is included if a form window is currently active (i.e., on top). If included, it immediately follows the EventTag value. The TxnType/ID or ListType/ID tags are included only if the form window is opened for an existing transaction or item.<br />
<br />
Notice that you get this aggregate ONLY if you are subscribed to a UI extension event (UIEventSubscriptionAdd) AND the end user clicks on your menu.
