<b><i>FromDeletedDate</i></b><br />
Selects objects deleted on or after this date. Both FromDeletedDate and ToDeletedDate 
must be between 1970-01-01 and 2038-01-19T03:14:07 (2038-01-18T19:14:07-08:00 
PST). (But note that ListDeletedQuery requests will only return records deleted 
within the last 90 days, even if the specified FromDeletedDate is earlier.)<br />
<br />
If FromDeletedDate includes a date but not a time (for example, if you set it 
to 2002-02-14), the time is assumed to be zero (2003-02-14T00:00:00). If you omit 
FromDeletedDate, it will be set to 1970-01-01T00:00:00 (1969-12-31T16:00:00-08:00 
PST).
