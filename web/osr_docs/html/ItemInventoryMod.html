<b><i>ItemInventoryMod</i></b><br />
Modifies an inventory item. 
Starting with qbXML spec 7.0, you can modify the income account ref, using the IncomeAccountRef aggregate and the  ApplyIncomeAccountRefToExistingTxns boolean.  You need to use the ApplyIncomeAccountRefToExistingTxns boolean because the QuickBooks UI displays a prompt asking whether the change should apply to existing transactions or not.  Specifying True for the boolean basically dismisses this with a "Yes" answer, allowing your changes to be made and changes any existing transactions that use the item with that AccountRef.  Specifying "False" means that the mod will not take affect if there are existing transactions.<br />
<br />
 
 Setting this to "True" should be used with caution and normally only after some user has indicated that they want those changes made to all those existing transactions!<br />
<br  />
 
 If any affected transactions are protected by a closing date and password, the IncomeAccountRef changes will not be made and so the Mod request will return an error without making the requested Mod.

<b>The Life Cycle of Inventory Items and Effects of Sales and Purchases </b> <br />
The value of inventory is set when an inventory item is created or bought. QuickBooks uses cost averaging and decreases the value of the inventory asset account at the price when the sale is recorded. <br /><br />

So, lets say a company starts carrying widgets as inventory items. First the inventory item must be created in QuickBooks. If the widgets are already in inventory based on a purchase made that will not be recorded in QuickBooks, the user or application would add the inventory item description along with the quantity on hand and the value (total purchase price) of the quantity on hand. <br /><br />

If the purchase is to be recorded in QuickBooks the inventory item would be created with quantity and value of 0 (zero). Then a bill would be added to QB which would increase the inventory quantity and value. Lets say we bought 10 widgets for $100. QuickBooks would then consider each widget to be worth $10. <br /><br />

The next day a customer buys 5 widgets for $20 each. A sales receipt or invoice is created for the purchase, the quantity of widgets is reduced by 5, to 5 and the value is reduced by $50 to $50. The inventory asset account is reduced by $50 and the undeposited funds or accounts receivable account is increased by $100. <br /><br />

It appears that widgets will be a big seller, so the small business owner goes out and buys 10 more widgets. However, the supplier has also noticed a widget buying trend, so he's increased the price to $25 each. So now our quantity is increased from 5 to 15 and the value is increased from $50 to $300, so they are considered to be worth $20 each. <br /><br />

After purchasing the widgets another customer decides to buy 10 widgets but the price has been raised to $50 each. After the sales receipt or invoice is entered, the inventory is reduced to 5 and the value is reduced to $100. The inventory asset account is reduced by $200 and the undeposited funds or accounts receivable account is increased by $500.
