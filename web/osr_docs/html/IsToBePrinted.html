<b><i>IsToBePrinted</i></b><br />
If IsToBePrinted is set to true, this transaction is on a list of forms to be printed later. 
The user can then choose to print all these forms at once.  
<br />
<br />
Notice that setting this field to true does not actually perform the printing. Only the QuickBooks user can
do that from within QuickBooks. This cannot be done from the SDK. Setting this field to false does not prevent the
QuickBooks user from printing the transaction later. It simply results in the transaction NOT being placed in
the list of transactions to be printed.
